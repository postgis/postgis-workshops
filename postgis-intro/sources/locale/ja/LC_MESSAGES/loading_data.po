"The **nlt** option stands for \"new layer type\". For shape file input in "

"**PRECISION** controls how numeric fields are represented in the database. "

"The order of arguments in :file:`ogr2ogr` is, roughly: executable, then "
"options, then **destination** location, then **source location**. So this is "
"the destination, the connection string for our PostgreSQL database. The \"Pg:"
