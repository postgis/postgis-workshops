msgid ":term:`SQL`, or \"Structured Query Language\", is a means of asking questions of, and updating data in, relational databases. You have already seen SQL when we created our first database.  Recall:"

msgid "But that was a question about the database.  Now that we've loaded data into our database, let's use SQL to ask questions of the data! For example,"

msgid "The ``some_columns`` are either column names or functions of column values. The ``some_data_source`` is either a single table, or a composite table created by joining two tables on a key or condition. The ``some_condition`` is a filter that restricts the number of rows to be returned."

#: ../../en/simple_sql.rst:81
msgid "Often, we are less interested in the individual rows than in a statistic that applies to all of them. So knowing the lengths of the neighborhood names might be less interesting than knowing the average length of the names. Functions that take in multiple rows and return a single result are called \"aggregate\" functions."

msgid "The aggregate functions in our last example were applied to every row in the result set. What if we want the summaries to be carried out over smaller groups within the overall result set? For that we add a ``GROUP BY`` clause. Aggregate functions often need an added ``GROUP BY`` statement to group the result-set by one or more columns."
