"A common requirement for production databases is the ability to track "
"history: how has the data changed between two dates, who made the changes, "
"and where did they occur? Some GIS systems track changes by including change "
"management in the client interface, but that adds a lot of **complexity** to "
"editing tools."

"Using the database and the trigger system, it's possible to add history "
"tracking to any table, while maintaining simple \"direct edit\" access to "
"the primary table."

"The history table uses a PostgreSQL-specific feature--the \"`timestamp range "
"<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rangetypes.html>`_\" type--to store "
"the time range that a history record was the \"live\" record. All the "
"timestamp ranges in the history table for a particular feature can be "
"expected to be non-overlapping but adjacent."

#: ../../en/history_tracking.rst:21
msgid ""
"The range for a new record will start at ``now()`` and have an open end "
"point, so that the range covers all time from the current time into the "

"Similarly, the time range for a deleted record will be updated to include "
"the current time as the end point of the time range."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/history_tracking.rst:36
msgid ""
"Searching time ranges is much simpler than searching a pair of timestamps, "
"because of the way an open time range encompasses all time from the start "
"point to infinity. The \"contains\" operator ``@>`` for ranges is the one we "
"will use."
msgstr ""

"Ranges can be very efficiently indexed using a GIST index, just like spatial "

"Next, we import the current state of the active table, **nyc_streets** into "
