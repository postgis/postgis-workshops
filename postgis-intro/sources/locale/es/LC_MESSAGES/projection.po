"The earth is not flat, and there is no simple way of putting it down on a "
"flat paper map (or computer screen), so people have come up with all sorts "
"of ingenious solutions, each with pros and cons. Some projections preserve "
"area, so all objects have a relative size to each other; other projections "
"preserve angles (conformal) like the Mercator projection; some projections "
"try to find a good intermediate mix with only little distortion on several "
"parameters. Common to all projections is that they transform the (spherical) "
"world onto a flat Cartesian coordinate system, and which projection to "
"choose depends on how you will be using the data."

"We've already encountered projections when we :ref:`loaded our nyc data "
"<loading_data>`.  (Recall that pesky SRID 26918).  Sometimes, however, you "
"need to transform and re-project between spatial reference systems. PostGIS "
"includes built-in support for changing the projection of data, using the :"
"command:`ST_Transform(geometry, srid)` function. For managing the spatial "
"reference identifiers on geometries, PostGIS provides the :command:"
"`ST_SRID(geometry)` and :command:`ST_SetSRID(geometry, srid)` functions."

"And what is definition of \"26918\"? As we saw in \":ref:`loading data "

"\"well-known text\" (:term:`WKT`) definition is in the ``srtext`` column, "

"Taken together, a coordinate and an SRID define a location on the globe. "
"Without an SRID, a coordinate is just an abstract notion. A \"Cartesian\" "
"coordinate plane is defined as a \"flat\" coordinate system placed on the "
"surface of Earth. Because PostGIS functions work on such a plane, comparison "
"operations require that both geometries be represented in the same SRID."

"Be careful of getting too happy with using :command:`ST_Transform` for on-"
"the-fly conversion. Spatial indexes are built using SRID of the stored "
"geometries.  If comparison are done in a different SRID, spatial indexes are "
"(often) not used. It is best practice to choose **one SRID** for all the "
"tables in your database. Only use the transformation function when you are "
"reading or writing data to external applications."
