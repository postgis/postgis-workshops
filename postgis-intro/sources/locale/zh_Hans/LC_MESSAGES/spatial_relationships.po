msgid "So far we have only used spatial functions that measure (:command:`ST_Area`, :command:`ST_Length`), serialize (:command:`ST_GeomFromText`) or deserialize (:command:`ST_AsGML`) geometries. What these functions have in common is that they only work on one geometry at a time."

msgid "Spatial databases are powerful because they not only store geometry, they also have the ability to compare *relationships between geometries*."

#: ../../en/spatial_relationships.rst:10
msgid "Questions like \"Which are the closest bike racks to a park?\" or \"Where are the intersections of subway lines and streets?\" can only be answered by comparing geometries representing the bike racks, streets, and subway lines."

msgid "The representation of the point was not very human readable (``0101000020266900000EEBD4CF27CF2141BC17D69516315141``) but it was an exact representation of the coordinate values. For a test like equality, using the exact coordinates is necessary."

msgstr ""

#: ../../en/spatial_relationships.rst:70
msgid "The opposite of ST_Intersects is :command:`ST_Disjoint(geometry A , geometry B)`. If two geometries are disjoint, they do not intersect, and vice-versa. In fact, it is often more efficient to test \"not intersects\" than to test \"disjoint\" because the intersects tests can be spatially indexed, while the disjoint test cannot."

msgstr ""

#: ../../en/spatial_relationships.rst:136
msgid "The :command:`ST_Distance(geometry A, geometry B)` calculates the *shortest* distance between two geometries and returns it as a float. This is useful for actually reporting back the distance between objects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/spatial_relationships.rst:148
msgid "For testing whether two objects are within a distance of one another, the :command:`ST_DWithin` function provides an index-accelerated true/false test. This is useful for questions like \"how many trees are within a 500 meter buffer of the road?\". You don't have to calculate an actual buffer, you just have to test the distance relationship."
