"Spatial joins are the bread-and-butter of spatial databases.  They allow you "
"to combine information from different tables by using spatial relationships "
"as the join key.  Much of what we think of as \"standard GIS analysis\" can "
"be expressed as spatial joins."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:8
msgid ""
"In the previous section, we explored spatial relationships using a two-step "
"process: first we extracted a subway station point for 'Broad St'; then, we "
"used that point to ask further questions such as \"what neighborhood is the "
"'Broad St' station in?\""
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:10
msgid ""
"Using a spatial join, we can answer the question in one step, retrieving "
"information about the subway station and the neighborhood that contains it:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:29
msgid ""
"We could have joined every subway station to its containing neighborhood, "
"but in this case we wanted information about just one.  Any function that "
"provides a true/false relationship between two tables can be used to drive a "
"spatial join, but the most commonly used ones are: :command:"
"`ST_Intersects`, :command:`ST_Contains`, and :command:`ST_DWithin`."

"The combination of a ``JOIN`` with a ``GROUP BY`` provides the kind of "
"analysis that is usually done in a GIS system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:36
msgid ""
"For example: **\"What is the population and racial make-up of the "
"neighborhoods of Manhattan?\"** Here we have a question that combines "
"information from about population from the census with the boundaries of "
"neighborhoods, with a restriction to just one borough of Manhattan."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:88
msgid ""
"What's going on here? Notionally (the actual evaluation order is optimized "
"under the covers by the database) this is what happens:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:90
msgid ""
"The ``JOIN`` clause creates a virtual table that includes columns from both "
"the neighborhoods and census tables."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:91
msgid ""
"The ``WHERE`` clause filters our virtual table to just rows in Manhattan."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:92
msgid ""
"The remaining rows are grouped by the neighborhood name and fed through the "
"aggregation function to :command:`Sum()` the population values."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:93
msgid ""
"After a little arithmetic and formatting (e.g., ``GROUP BY``, ``ORDER BY``) "
"on the final numbers, our query spits out the percentages."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:97
msgid ""
"The ``JOIN`` clause combines two ``FROM`` items.  By default, we are using "
"an ``INNER JOIN``, but there are four other types of joins. For further "
"information see the `join_type <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/"
"interactive/sql-select.html#SQL-FROM>`_ definition in the PostgreSQL "
"documentation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:99
msgid ""
"We can also use distance tests as a join key, to create summarized \"all "
"items within a radius\" queries. Let's explore the racial geography of New "
"York using distance queries."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:101
msgid "First, let's get the baseline racial make-up of the city."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:118
msgid ""
"So, of the 8M people in New York, about 44% are recorded as \"white\" and "
"26% are recorded as \"black\"."

msgid ""
"Duke Ellington once sang that \"You / must take the A-train / To / go to "
"Sugar Hill way up in Harlem.\" As we saw earlier, Harlem has far and away "
"the highest African-American population in Manhattan (80.5%). Is the same "
"true of Duke's A-train?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:122
msgid ""
"First, note that the contents of the ``nyc_subway_stations`` table "
"``routes`` field is what we are interested in to find the A-train. The "
"values in there are a little complex."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:140
msgid ""
"The ``DISTINCT`` keyword eliminates duplicate rows from the result.  Without "
"the ``DISTINCT`` keyword, the query above identifies 491 results instead of "
"73."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:142
msgid ""
"So to find the A-train, we will want any row in ``routes`` that has an 'A' "
"in it. We can do this a number of ways, but today we will use the fact that :"
"command:`strpos(routes,'A')` will return a non-zero number only if 'A' is in "
"the ``routes`` field."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:162
msgid ""
"Let's summarize the racial make-up of within 200 meters of the A-train line."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:181
msgid ""
"So the racial make-up along the A-train isn't radically different from the "
"make-up of New York City as a whole."
msgstr ""

msgid "Advanced Join"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:186
msgid ""
"In the last section we saw that the A-train didn't serve a population that "
"differed much from the racial make-up of the rest of the city. Are there any "
"trains that have a non-average racial make-up?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:188
msgid ""
"To answer that question, we'll add another join to our query, so that we can "
"simultaneously calculate the make-up of many subway lines at once. To do "
"that, we'll need to create a new table that enumerates all the lines we want "
"to summarize."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:199
msgid "Now we can join the table of subway lines onto our original query."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/joins.rst:244
msgid ""
"As before, the joins create a virtual table of all the possible combinations "
"available within the constraints of the ``JOIN ON`` restrictions, and those "
"rows are then fed into a ``GROUP`` summary. The spatial magic is in the "
"``ST_DWithin`` function, that ensures only census blocks close to the "
"appropriate subway stations are included in the calculation."
