"Databases can only retrieve information as fast as they can get it off of "
"disk. Small databases will float up entirely into RAM cache, and get away "
"from physical disk limitations, but for large databases, access to the "
"physical disk will be a limiting stop in disk access speed."

#: ../../en/clusterindex.rst:8
msgid ""
"Data is written to disk opportunistically, so there is not necessarily any "
"correlation between the order data is stored on the disk and the way it will "
"be accessed or organized by applications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/clusterindex.rst:13
msgid ""
"One way to speed up access to data is to ensure that records which is likely "
"to be retrieved together in the same result set are located in similar "
"physical locations on the hard disk platters. This is called \"clustering\"."

#: ../../en/clusterindex.rst:15
msgid ""
"The right clustering scheme to use can be tricky, but a general rule "
"applies: indexes define a natural ordering scheme for data which is similar "
"to the access pattern that will be used in retrieving the data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/clusterindex.rst:20
msgid ""
"Because of this, ordering the data on the disk in the same order as the "
"index can provide a speed advantage in some cases."

msgid ""
"Spatial data tends to be accessed in spatially correlated windows: think of "
"the map window in a web or desktop application. All the data in the windows "
"has similar location value (or it wouldn't be in the window!)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/clusterindex.rst:27
msgid ""
"So, clustering based on a spatial index makes sense for spatial data that is "
"going to be accessed with spatial queries: similar things tend to have "
"similar locations."

msgid "Let's cluster our ``nyc_census_blocks`` based on their spatial index:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/clusterindex.rst:36
msgid ""
"The command re-writes the ``nyc_census_blocks`` in the order defined by the "
"spatial index ``nyc_census_blocks_geom_gist``. Can you perceive a speed "
"difference? Maybe not, because the original data may have already had some "
"pre-existing spatial ordering (this is not uncommon in GIS data sets)."

msgid "Disk Versus Memory/SSD"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/clusterindex.rst:41
msgid ""
"Most modern databases are run using SSD storage, which is much faster at "
"random access than old spinning magnetic media. Also, most modern databases "
"are running on top of data which is small enough to fit into the RAM of the "
"database server, and ends up there as the operating system \"virtual "
"filesystem\" caches it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Is clustering still necessary?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/clusterindex.rst:45
msgid ""
"Surprisingly, yes. Keeping records that are \"near each other\" in space "
"\"near each other\" in memory increases the odds that related records will "
"move up the servers \"memory cache heirarchy\" together, and thus make "
"memory accesses faster."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/clusterindex.rst:50
msgid ""
"System RAM is not the fastest memory on a modern computer. There are several "
"levels of cache between system RAM and the actual CPU, and the underlying "
"operating system and processor will move data up and down the cache "
"heirarchy in blocks. If the block getting moved up happens to include the "
"piece of data the system will need next... that's a big win. Correlating the "
"memory structure with the spatial structure is a way in increase the odds of "
"that win happening."

msgid "Does Index Structure Matter?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/clusterindex.rst:55
msgid ""
"In theory, yes. In practice, no really. As long as the index is a \"pretty "
"good\" spatial decomposition of the data, the main determinant of "
"performance will be the order of the actual table tuples."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/clusterindex.rst:57
msgid ""
"The difference between \"no index\" and \"index\" is generally huge and "
"highly measurable. The difference between \"mediocre index\" and \"great "
"index\" usually takes quite careful measurement to discern, and can be very "
"sensitive to the workload being tested."
