Rasters
=========

PostGIS supports another kind of spatial data type called a *raster*.
Raster data, much like geometry data, uses **Cartesian coordinates** and a spatial reference system.
However instead of vector data, raster data is represented as an n-dimensional matrix consisting of pixels and bands.
The bands defines the number of matrices you have. Each pixel stores a value corresponding to each band.
So a 3-banded raster such as an RGB image, would have 3 values for each pixel corresponding to the Red-Green-Blue bands.

Although pretty pictures such as those you see on your TV screen are rasters,
rasters may not be that exciting to look at.
In a nutshell, a raster is a matrix, pinned on a coordinate system,
that has values that can represent anything you want them to represent.

Since rasters live in cartesian space, rasters can interact with geometries.
PostGIS offers many functions that take as input both rasters and geometries.
Many operations applied to rasters will result in geometries. Common ones are the `ST_Polygon`, `ST_Envelope`, `ST_ConvexHull`, and `ST_MinConvexHull`
as shown below.  When you cast a raster to a geometry, what is output is the `ST_ConvexHull` of the raster.

.. image:: ./rasters/postgis_raster.jpg

The raster format is commonly used to store elevation data, temperature data, satellite data, and thematic data representing things like environmental contamination, population density, and environmental hazard occurrences.
You can use rasters to store any numeric data that has a meaningful coordinate location.
The only restriction is that for all data in a specific band the numeric data types have to be the same.

Although raster data can be created from scratch in PostGIS, a more common approach is to load raster data from various formats using the :command:`raster2pgsql` command line tool packaged with PostGIS.
Before all of that, you must enable raster support in your database by running the command:

.. code-block:: sql

  CREATE EXTENSION postgis_raster;


Creating Rasters From Geometries
--------------------------------
We'll start off by first creating raster data from vector data, and then move on to the more exciting approach of loading data from a raster source.
You will find that raster data is available in abundance and often free from various government sites.

We'll start by converting some geometries into rasters using `ST_AsRaster <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_AsRaster.html>`_ function as follows.

.. code-block:: sql

  CREATE TABLE rasters (name varchar, rast raster);

  INSERT INTO rasters(name, rast)
  SELECT f.word, ST_AsRaster(geom, width=>150, height=>150)
  FROM (VALUES ('Hello'), ('Raster') ) AS f(word)
    , ST_Letters(word) AS geom;

  CREATE INDEX ix_rasters_rast
    ON rasters USING gist(ST_ConvexHull(rast));

The above example CREATEs a table (**rasters**) from geometries formed from letters using the PostGIS 3.2+ `ST_Letters <https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Letters.html>`_ function. Rasters similar to geometries, can take advantage of spatial indexes. The spatial index used for raster
is a functional index that indexes the geometry convexhull of the raster.

You can see some useful metadata of your rasters
with the following query which utilizes the postgis raster `ST_Count <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_Count.html>`_ function to count the number of pixels that have data and the `ST_MetaData <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_MetaData.html>`_ function to provide all sorts of useful background info for our rasters.

.. code-block:: sql

 SELECT name, ST_Count(rast) As num_pixels, md.*
    FROM rasters, ST_MetaData(rast) AS md;

.. code-block::

  name  | num_pixels | upperleftx |    upperlefty     | width | height |       scalex       |       scaley        | skewx | skewy | srid | numbands
  --------+------------+------------+-------------------+-------+--------+--------------------+---------------------+-------+-------+------+----------
  Hello  |      13926 |          0 | 77.10000000000001 |   150 |    150 |  1.226888888888889 | -0.5173333333333334 |     0 |     0 |    0 |        1
  Raster |      11967 |          0 |              75.4 |   150 |    150 | 1.7226319023207244 | -0.5086666666666667 |     0 |     0 |    0 |        1
  (2 rows)

.. note::

  There are two levels of raster functions.
  There are functions such as ST_MetaData that work at the raster level and there are functions such as
  :command:`ST_Count` function and `ST_BandMetaData <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_BandMetaData.html>`_
  function that work at the band level.
  Most functions in postgis raster that work at the
  band level, work with only one band at a time, and assume the band you want is `1`.

If you have a multi-band raster, and you need to count the not no-data valued pixels in a band other than 1, you would explicitly specify the band number as follows `ST_Count(rast,2)`.

Note how all the rasters have a 150x150 dimension.  This is not ideal. This means that in order to force that,
our rasters, are squished in all sorts of ways.  If only we could see the ugliness of the rasters before us.

Loading Rasters using raster2pgsql
-----------------------------------
`raster2pgsql <https://postgis.net/docs/using_raster_dataman.html#RT_Raster_Loader>`_ is a command-line tool often packaged with PostGIS.
If you are on windows and used application stackbuilder PostGIS Bundle, you'll find :command:`raster2pgsql.exe` in the folder ``C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\15\bin``  where the *15* should be replaced with the version of PostgreSQL you are running.

If you are using Postgres.App, you'll find raster2pgsql among the other `Postgres.app CLI Tools <https://postgresapp.com/documentation/cli-tools.html>`_.

On Ubuntu and Debian, you will need

.. code-block:: sh

  apt install postgis

to have the PostGIS commandline tools installed.
This may install an additional version of PostgreSQL as well.
You can see a list of clusters in Debian/Ubuntu using the :command:`pg_lsclusters` command
and drop them using the :command:`pg_dropcluster` command.

For this and later exercises, we'll be using `nyc_dem.tif` found in the file
`PG Raster Workshop Dataset https://postgis.net/stuff/workshop-data/postgis_raster_workshop.zip <https://postgis.net/stuff/workshop-data/postgis_raster_workshop.zip>`_. For some geometry/raster examples, we will also be using NYC data loaded from prior chapters.  In-lieu of loading the tif, you can restore the `nyc_dem.backup` included in the zip file
in your database using the :command:`pg_restore` commandline tool or the pgAdmin **Restore** menu.

.. note::

  This raster data was sourced from `NYC DEM 1-foot Integer <https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/1-foot-Digital-Elevation-Model-DEM-/dpc8-z3jc>`_ which is a 3GB DEM tif representing elevation relative to sea level with buildings and overwater removed. We then created a lower res version of it.


The :command:`raster2pgsql` tool is similar to the :command:`shp2gpsql` except instead of loading ESRI shapefiles into PostGIS geometry/geography tables, it loads any GDAL supported raster format into
raster tables. Just like :command:`shp2pgsql` you can pass it a spatial reference id (SRID) of the source.
Unlike :command:`shp2pgsql` it can infer the spatial references system of the source data if your source data has suitable metadata.

For a full exposure of all the possible switches offered refer to `raster2pgsql options <https://postgis.net/docs/using_raster_dataman.html#RT_Loading_Rasters>`_.

Some other notable options :command:`raster2pgsql` offers which we will not cover are:

* Ability to denote the SRID of the source. Instead, we'll rely on raster2pgsql guessing skills.
* Ability to set the `nodata` value, when not specified, raster2pgsql tries to infer from the file.
* Abiliity to load out-of-database rasters.

To load all the tif files in our folder and also create overviews, we would run the below.

.. code-block:: sh

  raster2pgsql -d -e -l 2,3 -I -C -M -F -Y -t 256x256 *.tif nyc_dem | psql -d nyc

* -d to drop the tables if they already exist
* The above command uses `-e` to do load immediately instead of committing in a transaction
* `-C` set raster constraints, this is useful for `raster_columns` to show info.
  You may want to combine with `-x` to exclude the extent constraint,
  which is a slow constraint to check and also hampers future loads in the table.
* `-M` to vacuum and analyze after load, to improve query planner statistics
* `-Y` to use copy in batches of 50. If you are running PostGIS 3.3 or higher, you can use `-Y 1000`
  to have copy be in batches of 1000, or even higher number. This will run faster, but will use more memory.
* `-l 2,3` to create over view tables: `o_2_ncy_dem` and `o_3_nyc_dem`. This is useful for viewing data.
* -I to create a spatial index
* `-F` to add file name, if you have only one tif file, this is kinda pointless.
  If you had multiple, this would be useful to tell you what file each row came from.
* `-t` to set the block size. Note if you are not sure the best size use, use `-t auto`
  instead and raster2pgql will use the same tiling as what was in the tif. The output
  will tell you what the blocksize is it chose. Cancel if it looks huge or weird.
  The original file had a size of 300x7 which is not ideal.
* Use :command:`psql` to run the generated sql against the database.
  If you want to dump to a file instead, use `> nyc_dem.sql`


For this example, we have only one tif file, so we could instead specify the full file name, instead of
`*.tif`.  If the files are not in your current directory, you can also specify a folder path with `*.tif`.

.. note::

  If you are on windows and need to reference the folder, make sure to
  include the drive letter such as `C:/workshop/*.tif`

You'll often hear in PostGIS lingo, the term **raster tile** and **raster** used somewhat interchangeably.
A raster tile really corresponds to a particular raster in a raster column which is a subset of a bigger raster, such as this
NYC dem data we just loaded.
This is because when rasters are loaded into PostGIS from big raster files, they chopped into many rows to make them
manageable.  Each raster in each row then is a part of a bigger raster.  Each tile covers same size area denoted by the blocksize you specified.
Rasters are sadly limited by the 1GB PostgreSQL `TOAST <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-toast.html>`_ limit
and also the slow process of detoasting and so we need to chop up in order to achieve decent performance or to even store them.

Viewing Rasters in Browser
------------------------------
Although pgAdmin and psql have no mechanism yet to view postgis rasters, we have a couple of options. For smallish rasters
the easiest is to output to a web-friendly raster format such as PNG using batteries included postgis raster
functions like `ST_AsPNG` or `ST_AsGDALRaster` listed in `PostGIS Raster output functions <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_reference.html#Raster_Outputs>`_.
As your rasters get larger, you'll want to graduate to a tool
such as QGIS to view them in all their glory or the GDAL family of commandline tools such as :command:`gdal_translate` to export them to other raster formats.  Remember though, postgis rasters are built for analysis,
not for generating pretty pictures for you to look at.

One caveat, by default all different raster types outputs are disabled. In order to utilize these,
you'll need to enable drivers, all or a subset as detailed
in `Enable GDAL Raster drivers <https://postgis.net/docs/postgis_gdal_enabled_drivers.html>`_

.. code-block:: sql

  SET postgis.gdal_enabled_drivers = 'ENABLE_ALL';

If you don't want to have to do this for each connection, you can set at the database level using:

.. code-block:: sql

  ALTER DATABASE nyc SET postgis.gdal_enabled_drivers = 'ENABLE_ALL';

Each new connection to the database will use that setting.

Run the below query and copy and paste the output into the address bar of your web browser.

.. code-block:: sql

 SELECT 'data:image/png;base64,' ||
    encode(ST_AsPNG(rast),'base64')
    FROM rasters
    WHERE name = 'Hello';

.. image:: ./rasters/hello.png

For the rasters created thus far, we didn't specify the number of bands nor did we even
define their relation to earth.  As such our rasters have an unknown spatial reference system (0).

You can think of a rasters exoskeletal as a geometry.
A matrix encased in a geometric envelop. In order to do useful analysis,
we need to georeference our rasters,
meaning we want each pixel (rectangle) to represent some meaningful plot of space.

The `ST_AsRaster` has many overloaded representations.
The earlier example used the simplest such implementation
and accepted the default arguments which are 8BUI and 1 band, with no data being 0.
If you need to use the other variants, you should use the
named arguments call syntax so that you don't accidentally
fall into the wrong variant of
the function or get **function is not unique** errors.

If you start with a geometry that has a spatial reference system,
you'll end up with a raster with same spatial reference system.
In this next example, we'll plop our words in New York in
bright cheery colors. We will also use pixel scale instead of width and height so that
our raster pixel sizes represent 1 meter x 1 meter of space.

.. code-block:: sql

  INSERT INTO rasters(name, rast)
  SELECT f.word || ' in New York' ,
    ST_AsRaster(geom,
      scalex => 1.0, scaley => -1.0,
      pixeltype => ARRAY['8BUI', '8BUI', '8BUI'],
      value => CASE WHEN word = 'Hello' THEN
        ARRAY[10,10,100] ELSE ARRAY[10,100,10] END,
      nodataval => ARRAY[0,0,0], gridx => NULL, gridy => NULL
      ) AS rast
  FROM (
      VALUES ('Hello'), ('Raster') ) AS f(word)
    , ST_SetSRID(
        ST_Translate(ST_Letters(word),586467,4504725), 26918
      ) AS geom;

If we then look at this, we'll see a non-squashed colored geometry.

.. code-block:: sql

 SELECT 'data:image/png;base64,' ||
    encode(ST_AsPNG(rast),'base64')
    FROM rasters
    WHERE name = 'Hello in New York';

.. image:: ./rasters/hello-ny.png

Repeat for Raster:

.. code-block:: sql

 SELECT 'data:image/png;base64,' ||
    encode(ST_AsPNG(rast),'base64')
    FROM rasters
    WHERE name = 'Raster in New York';

.. image:: ./rasters/raster-ny.png

What is more telling, if we rerun the

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT name, ST_Count(rast) As num_pixels, md.*
    FROM rasters, ST_MetaData(rast) AS md;

Observe the metadata of the New York entries. They have the New York state plane meter spatial reference system.
They also have the same scale.  Since each unit is 1x1 meter,
the width of the word **Raster** is now wider than **Hello**.

.. code-block::

        name         | num_pixels | upperleftx |    upperlefty     | width | height |       scalex       |       scaley        | skewx | skewy | srid  | numbands

  (4 rows)

Raster Spatial Catalog tables
------------------------------
Similar to the geometry and geography types, raster has a set of catalogs that show you
all raster columns in your database.
These are `raster_columns and raster_overviews <https://postgis.net/docs/using_raster_dataman.html#RT_Raster_Catalog>`_.


raster_columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `raster_columns` view to the sibling to the  `geometry_columns` and `geography_columns`, providing much the same
data and more, but for raster columns.

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT *
      FROM raster_columns;

Explore the table, and you'll find this:

.. code-block::

  r_table_catalog | r_table_schema | r_table_name | r_raster_column | srid | scale_x | scale_y | blocksize_x | blocksize_y | same_alignment | regular_blocking | num_bands | pixel_types | nodata_values | out_db | extent | spatial_index
  ----------------+----------------+--------------+-----------------+------+---------+---------+-------------+-------------+----------------+------------------+-----------+-------------+---------------+--------+--------+---------------
  nyc             | public         | rasters      | rast            |    0 |         |         |             |             | f              | f                |           |             |               |        |        | t
  nyc             | public         | nyc_dem      | rast            | 2263 |      10 |     -10 |         256 |         256 | t              | f                |         1 | {16BUI}     | {NULL}        | {f}    |        | t
  nyc             | public         | o_2_nyc_dem  | rast            | 2263 |      20 |     -20 |         256 |         256 | t              | f                |         1 | {16BUI}     | {NULL}        | {f}    |        | t
  nyc             | public         | o_3_nyc_dem  | rast            | 2263 |      30 |     -30 |         256 |         256 | t              | f                |         1 | {16BUI}     | {NULL}        | {f}    |        | t
  (4 rows)

a disappointing row of largely unfilled information for the `rasters` table.

Unlike geometry and geography, raster does not support type modifiers, because type modifier space is too
limited and there are more critical properties than what can fit in a type modifier.

Raster instead relies on constraints, and reads these constraints back as part of the view.

Look at the other rows from the tables we loaded using :command:`raster2pgsql`.
Because we used the `-C` switch :command:`raster2pgsql` added constraints for the srid and other info it was able to read from the tif or that we passed in. The overview tables generated with the `-l` switch `o_2_nyc_dem` and `o_3_nyc_dem` show up as well.

Let's try to add some constraints to our table.

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT AddRasterConstraints('public'::name, 'rasters'::name, 'rast'::name);


And you'll be bombarded with a whole bunch of notices about how your raster data is a mess
and nothing can be constrained. If you look at raster_columns again, still the same disappointing
story of many blank rows for `rasters`.

In order for constraints to be applied,
all rasters in your table must be constrainable by at least one rule.

We can perhaps do this, let's just lie and say all our data is in New York State plane.

.. code-block:: sql

  UPDATE rasters SET rast = ST_SetSRID(rast,26918)
    WHERE ST_SRID(rast) <> 26918;

  SELECT AddRasterConstraints('public'::name, 'rasters'::name, 'rast'::name);
  SELECT r_table_name AS t, r_raster_column AS c, srid,
    blocksize_x AS bx, blocksize_y AS by, scale_x AS sx, scale_y AS sy,
    ST_AsText(extent) AS e
    FROM raster_columns
  WHERE r_table_name = 'rasters';

Ah progress:

.. code-block::

  t         |  c   | srid  | bx  | by  | sx | sy |  e
  ----------+------+-------+-----+-----+----+----+------------------------------------------
  rasters   | rast | 26918 | 150 | 150 |    |    | POLYGON((0 -0.90000000000..
  (1 row)

The more you can constrain all your rasters, the more columns you'll see filled in
and also the more operations you'll be able to do across all the tiles in your raster.
Keep in mind that in some cases, you may not want to apply all constraints.

For example, if you plan to load more data into your raster table,
you'll want to skip the extent constraint since that
would require that all rasters are within the extent of the extent constraint.

raster_overviews
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Raster overview columns appear both in the `raster_columns` meta catalog and another meta catalog called
`raster_overviews`. Overviews are used mostly to speed up viewing at higher zoom levels.
They can also be used for quick back of the envelop analysis, providing less accurate stats, but at a much faster
speed than applying to the raw raster table.

To inspect the overviews, run:

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT *
      FROM raster_overviews;

and you'll see the output:

.. code-block::

  o_table_catalog | o_table_schema | o_table_name | o_raster_column | r_table_catalog | r_table_schema | r_table_name | r_raster_column | overview_factor
  ----------------+----------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+----------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------
  nyc             | public         | o_2_nyc_dem  | rast            | nyc             | public         | nyc_dem      | rast            |               2
  nyc             | public         | o_3_nyc_dem  | rast            | nyc             | public         | nyc_dem      | rast            |               3
  (2 rows)

The `raster_overviews` table only provides you the overview_factor and the name of the parent table.
All this information is something you could have
figured out yourself by the `raster2pgsql` naming convention for overviews.

The `overview_factor` tells you at what resolution the row is with respect to it's parent.
An `overview_factor` of `2` means that 2x2 = 4 tiles can fit into one overview_2 tile.
Similarly an overview_factor of `3` meants that 2x2x2 = 8 tiles
of the original can be shoved into an overview_3 tile.


Common Raster Functions
--------------------------
The :command:`postgis_raster` extension has over 100 functions to choose from.
PostGIS raster functionality was patterned after the PostGIS geometry support.
You'll find an overlap of functions between raster and geometry where it makes sense.
Common ones you'll use that have equivalent in geometry world are
:command:`ST_Intersects`, :command:`ST_SetSRID`, :command:`ST_SRID`, :command:`ST_Union`,
:command:`ST_Intersection`, and :command:`ST_Transform`.

In addition to those overlapping functions, it supports the `&&` overlap operator between rasters and between a raster and geometry.
It also offers many functions that work in conjunction with geometry
or are very specific to rasters.

You need a function like :command:`ST_Union` to reconstitute a region.
Because performance gets slow, the more pixels a function needs to analyse, you need a fast acting function
:command:`ST_Clip` to clip the rasters to just the portions of interest for your analysis.

Finally you need :command:`ST_Intersects` or :command:`&&` to zoom in on the raster tiles that contain your areas of interest.
The `&&` operator, is a faster process than the `ST_Intersects`. Both can take advantage of raster spatial indexes.
We'll cover these bread and butter functions first before moving on to other sections where we will use them in concert
with other raster and geometry functions.

Unioning Rasters with ST_Union
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The `ST_Union <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_Union.html>`_ function for raster,
just as the geometry equivalent :command:`ST_Union`, aggregates a set of rasters together
into a single raster.  However, just as with geometry,
not all rasters can be combined together,
but the rules for raster unioning are more complicated than geometry rules.
In the case of geometries, all you need is to have the same spatial reference system,
but for rasters that is not sufficient.

If you were to attempt, the following:

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT ST_Union(rast)
      FROM rasters;

You'd be summarily punished with an error:

**ERROR:  rt_raster_from_two_rasters: The two rasters provided do not have the same alignment
SQL state: XX000**

What is this same alignment thing, that is preventing you from unioning your precious rasters?

In order for rasters to be combined, they need to be on the same grid so to speak. Meaning
they must have same pixel sizes, same orientation (the skew), same spatial reference system,
and their pixels must not cut into each other, meaning they share the same worldly pixel grid.

If you try the same query, but just with words we carefully placed in New York.

Again, the same error. These are the same spatial ref system, the same pixel sizes,
and yet it's still not good enough.
Because their grids are off.

We can fix this by shifting the upper left y coordinates ever so slightly and then trying again.
If our grids start at integer level since our pixel sizes are whole integer,
then the pixels won't cut into each other.

.. code-block:: sql

  UPDATE rasters SET rast = ST_SetUpperLeft(rast,
    ST_UpperLeftX(rast)::integer,
    ST_UpperLeftY(rast)::integer)
  WHERE name LIKE '%New York';

  SELECT ST_Union(rast ORDER BY name)
    FROM rasters
    WHERE name LIKE '%New York%';

Voila it worked, and if we were to view, we'd see something like this:

.. image:: ./rasters/hello-raster-ny.png

.. note::

  If ever you are unclear why your rasters don't have the same alignment, you can use the function
  `ST_SameAlignment <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_SameAlignment.html>`_, which will compare 2 rasters
  or a set of rasters and tell you if they have the same alignment.  If you have notices enabled, the
  NOTICE will tell you what is off with the rasters in question. The
  `ST_NotSameAlignmentReason <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_NotSameAlignmentReason.html>`_, instead of just a notice
  will output the reason. It however only works with two rasters at a time.

One major way in which the `ST_Union(raster) <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_Union.html>`_ raster function deviates
from the `ST_Union(geometry) <https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Union.html>`_ geometry function is that
it allows for an argument called *uniontype*.  This argument by default is set to `LAST` if you don't specify it,
which means, take the **LAST** raster pixel values in occasions where the raster pixel values overlap.
As a general rule, pixels in a band that are marked as no-data are ignored.

Just as with most aggregates in PostgreSQL, you can put a :command:`ORDER BY` clause as part of the function call
as is done in the prior example.  Specifying the order, allows you to control which raster takes priority.
So in our prior example, *Raster* trumped *Hello* because *Raster* is alphabetically last.

Observe, if you switch the order:

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT ST_Union(rast ORDER BY name DESC)
    FROM rasters
    WHERE name LIKE '%New York%';

.. image:: ./rasters/raster-hello-ny.png

Then *Hello* trumps *Raster* because Hello is now the last overlaid.

The :command:`FIRST` union type is the reverse of :command:`LAST`.

But on occassion, **LAST** may not be the right operation.
Let's suppose our rasters represented two different sets of
observations from two different devices. These devices measure the same
thing, and we aren't sure which is right when they cross paths,
so we'd instead like to take the `MEAN` of the results.  We'd do this:

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT ST_Union(rast, 'MEAN')
    FROM rasters
    WHERE name LIKE '%New York%';

Voila it worked, and if we were to view, we'd see something like this:

.. image:: ./rasters/hello-raster-ny-mean.png

So instead of trumping, we have a blending of the two forces.
In the case of :command:`MEAN` union type, there is no point in specifying order,
because the result would be the average of overlapping pixel values.

Note that for geometries
since geometries are vector and thus have no values besides there or not there,
there really isn't any ambiguity on how to combine two vectors when they intersect.

Another feature of the raster :command:`ST_Union` we glossed over,
is this idea of if you should return all bands or just some bands.
When you don't specify what bands to union, :command:`ST_Union` will combine
same banded numbers and use the :command:`LAST` unioning
strategy.  If you have multiple bands, this may not be what you want to do.
Perhaps you only want to union, the second band.
In this case, the Green Band and you want the count of pixel values.

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT ST_BandPixelType(ST_Union(rast, 2, 'COUNT'))
    FROM rasters
    WHERE name LIKE '%New York%';

.. code-block::

  st_bandpixeltype
  ------------------
  32BUI
  (1 row)

Note in the case of the **COUNT** union type, which counts the number of pixels filled in and returns that value,
the result is always a **32BUI** similar to how when you do a :command:`COUNT` in sql, the result is always a bigint,
to accommodate large counts.

In other cases, the band pixel type does not change and is set to the max value or rounded
if the amounts exceed the bounds of the type.
Why would anyone ever want to count pixels that intersect at a location.
Well suppose each of your rasters
represent police squadrons and incidents of arrests in the areas.
Each value, might represent a different kind
of arrest reason. You are doing stats on how many arrests in each region,
therefore you only care about the count of arrests.

Or perhaps, you want to do all bands, but you want different strategies.

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT ST_Union(rast, ARRAY[(1, 'MAX'),
    (2, 'MEAN'),
    (3, 'RANGE')]::unionarg[])
    FROM rasters
    WHERE name LIKE '%New York%';

Using the *unionarg[]* variant of the :command:`ST_Union` function, also allows you to shuffle the order of the bands.

Clipping Rasters with help of ST_Intersects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The `ST_Clip <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_Clip.html>`_ function is one of the most widely used functions
for PostGIS rasters.  The main reason is the more pixels you need to inspect or do operations on, the slower your processing.
**ST_Clip** clips your raster to just the area of interest, so you can isolate your operations to just that area.

This function is also special in that it utilizes the power of geometry to help raster analysis.
To reduce the number of pixels, :command:`ST_Union` has to handle, each raster is clipped first to the area we are interested in.

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT ST_Union( ST_Clip(r.rast, g.geom) )
    FROM rasters AS r
        INNER JOIN
          ST_Buffer(ST_Point(586598, 4504816, 26918), 100 ) AS g(geom)
            ON ST_Intersects(r.rast, g.geom)
    WHERE r.name LIKE '%New York%';

This example showcases several functions working in unison.  The :command:`ST_Intersects` function employed
is the one packaged with **postgis_raster** and can intersect 2 rasters or a raster and a geometry.
Similar to the geometry :command:`ST_Intersects` the `raster ST_Intersects <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_Intersects.html>`_
can take advantage of spatial indexes on the raster or geometry tables.

.. note::

  By default ST_Clip will leave out pixels where the centroid of the pixel doesn't 
  intersect the geometry.  This can be annoying for big pixels and you may prefer
  to instead, include a pixel if any part of the pixel touches the geometry.
  Introduced in PostGIS 3.5, is the touched argument. 
  Replace your  `ST_Clip(r.rast, g.geom)` with  `ST_Clip(r.rast, g.geom, touched => true)`
  and voila any pixels that intersect your geometry in any way will be included.


Converting Rasters to Geometries
------------------------------------
Rasters can just as easily be morphed into geometries.

The polygon of a raster with ST_Polygon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lets start with our prior example, but convert it to a polygon using `ST_Polygon <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_Polygon.html>`_ function.

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT ST_Polygon(ST_Union( ST_Clip(r.rast, g.geom) ))
    FROM rasters AS r
        INNER JOIN
          ST_Buffer(ST_Point(586598, 4504816, 26918), 100 ) AS g(geom)
            ON ST_Intersects(r.rast, g.geom)
    WHERE r.name LIKE '%New York%';

If you click on the geometry viewer in pgAdmin, you can see this in all it's glory without any hacks.

.. image:: ./rasters/raster_as_geometry.png

:command:`ST_Polygon` considers all the pixels that have values (not no-data) in a particular band,
and converts them to geometry.  Like many other functions in raster, :command:`ST_Polygon` only considers 1 band.
If no band is specified, it will consider only the first band.

The pixel rectangles of a raster with ST_PixelAsPolygons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another popularly used function is the `ST_PixelAsPolygons <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_PixelAsPolygons.html>`_ function. You should rarely use :command:`ST_PixelAsPolygons` on a large raster without first
clipping because you will end up with millions of rows, one for each pixel.

:command:`ST_PixelAsPolygons` returns a table consisting of geom, val, x, and y.
Where x is the column number, and y is the row number in the raster.

:command:`ST_PixelAsPolygons` similar to other raster functions works
on one band at a time and works on band 1 if no band is specified.
It also by default returns only pixels that have values.

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT gv.*
    FROM rasters AS r
      CROSS JOIN LATERAL ST_PixelAsPolygons(rast) AS gv
    WHERE r.name LIKE '%New York%'
    LIMIT 10;

Which outputs:

.. image:: ./rasters/raster-st-pixel-as-polygons-pgAdmin-Grid.png

and if we inspect using the geometry viewer, we'd see:

.. image:: ./rasters/raster-st-pixel-as-polygons-pgAdmin-geomviewer.png

If we want all pixels of all our bands, we'd need to do something like below.
Note the differences in this example from previous.

  1. Setting  :command:`exclude_nodata_value` to make sure all pixels are returned so that
  our sets of calls return the same number of rows. The rows out of the function will be naturally in the same order.

  2. Using the `PostgreSQL ROWS FROM constructor <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-TABLEFUNCTIONS>`_ , and aliasing each set of columns
  from our function output with names. So for example the band 1 columns (geom, val, x, y)
  are renamed to g1, v1, x1, x2

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT pp.g1, pp.v1, pp.v2, pp.v3
    FROM rasters AS r
      CROSS JOIN LATERAL
      ROWS FROM (
        ST_PixelAsPolygons(rast, 1, exclude_nodata_value => false ),
        ST_PixelAsPolygons(rast, 2, exclude_nodata_value => false),
        ST_PixelAsPolygons(rast, 3, exclude_nodata_value => false )
        ) AS pp(g1, v1, x1, y1,
          g2, v2, x2, y2,
          g3, v3, x3, y3 )
    WHERE r.name LIKE '%New York%'
     AND ( pp.v1 = 0 OR  pp.v2 > 0 OR pp.v3 > 0) ;

.. note::

  We used CROSS JOIN LATERAL in these examples because
  we wanted to be explicit what we are doing.
  Since these are all set returning functions, you can replace CROSS JOIN LATERAL
  with , for short-hand.  We'll use a , in the next set of examples

Dumping polygons with ST_DumpAsPolygons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Raster also introduces an additional composite type called a :command:`geomval`.
Consider a :command:`geomval` as the offspring of a geometry and raster.
It contains a geometry and it contains a pixel value.

You will find several raster functions that return geomvals.

A commonly used function that outputs geomvals is `ST_DumpAsPolygons <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_DumpAsPolygons.html>`_,
which returns a set of contiguous pixels with the same value as a polygon.  Again this by default will only check band 1 and exclude no data values
unless you override. This example selects only polygons from band 2.
You can also apply filters to the values. For most use cases, :command:`ST_DumpAsPolygons` is a better option than :command:`ST_PixelAsPolygons` as it will return far fewer rows.

This will output 6 rows, and return polygons corresponding to the letters
in "Raster".

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT gv.geom , gv.val
    FROM rasters AS r,
      ST_DumpAsPolygons(rast, 2) AS gv
    WHERE r.name LIKE '%New York%'
        AND gv.val = 100;

Note that it doesn't return a single geometry, because it finds continguous set of pixels
with the same value that form a polygon.
Even though all these values are the same, they are not continguous.

.. image:: ./rasters/st-dump-as-polygons.png

A common approach to produce more complex geometries is to group by the values and union.

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT ST_Union(gv.geom) AS geom , gv.val
    FROM rasters AS r,
      ST_DumpAsPolygons(rast, 2) AS gv
    WHERE r.name LIKE '%New York%'
    GROUP BY gv.val;

This will give you 2 rows back corresponding to the words "Raster" and "Hello".

Statistics
-----------------------
The most important thing to understand about rasters is that they are statistical tools
for storing data in arrays, that you may happen to be able to make look pretty on a screen.

You can find a menu of these statistical functions
in `Raster Band Statistics <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_reference.html#RasterBand_Stats>`_.

ST_SummaryStatsAgg and ST_SummaryStats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Want all stats for a set or rasters, reach for the function `ST_SummaryStatsAgg <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_SummaryStatsAgg.html>`_.

This query takes about 10 seconds and gives you a summary of the whole table:

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT (ST_SummaryStatsAgg(rast, 1, true, 1)).* AS sa
      FROM o_3_nyc_dem;

Outputs:

.. code-block::

  count      |    sum     |       mean       |      stddev      | min | max
  -----------+------------+------------------+------------------+-----+-----
  246794100  | 4555256024 | 18.4577184948911 | 39.4416860598687 |   0 | 411
  (1 row)

Which tells we have a lot of pixels and our max elevation is 411 ft.

If you have built overviews, and just need a rough estimate of your mins, maxs, and means
use one of your overviews. This next query returns roughly the same values for mins, maxs, and means
as the prior but in about 1 second instead of 10.

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT (ST_SummaryStatsAgg(rast, 1, true, 1)).* AS sa
      FROM o_3_nyc_dem ;

Now armed with this bit of information, we can ask more questions.

ST_Histogram
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generally you won't want stats for your whole table, but instead just stats for a particular area,
in that case, you'll want to also employ our old friends :command:`ST_Intersects` and :command:`ST_Clip`.
If you are also in need of a raster statistics function that doesn't have an aggregate version, you'll want to carry
:command:`ST_Union` along for the ride.

For this next example we'll use a different stats function `ST_Histogram <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_Histogram.html>`_
which has no aggregate equivalent, and for this particular variant, is a set returning function.
We are using the same area of interest as some prior examples,
but we also need to employ geometry :command:`ST_Transform` to transform our NY state plane meters geometry
to our NYC State Plane feet rasters.  It is almost always more performant to transform the geometry instead of raster
and definitely if your geometry is just a single one.

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT (ST_Quantile( ST_Union( ST_Clip(r.rast, g.geom) ), ARRAY[0.25,0.50,0.75, 1.0] )).*
      FROM nyc_dem AS r
         INNER JOIN
          ST_Transform(
            ST_Buffer(ST_Point(586598, 4504816, 26918), 100 ),
              2263) AS g(geom)
          ON  ST_Intersects(r.rast, g.geom);

the above query completes in under 60ms and outputs:

.. code-block::

  quantile  | value
  ----------+-------
      0.25  |    52
      0.5   |    57
      0.75  |    68
      1     |    78
  (4 rows)


Creating Derivative Rasters
----------------------------
PostGIS raster comes packaged with a number of functions for editing rasters.
These functions are both used for editing as well as creating derivative raster data sets.
You will find these listed in `Raster Editors <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_reference.html#Raster_Editors>`_
and `Raster Management <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_reference.html#Raster_Management_Functions>`_.

Transforming rasters with ST_Transform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most of our data is in NY State Plane meters (SRID: 26918),
however our DEM raster dataset is in NY State Plane feet (SRID: 2263).
For the least cumbersome workflow, we need our core datasets to be in the same spatial reference system.

The `raster ST_Transform <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_Transform.html>`_ is the function most suited for this job.

In order to create a new nyc dem dataset in NY State Plane meters, we'll do the following:

.. code-block:: sql

  CREATE TABLE nyc_dem_26918 AS
  WITH ref AS (SELECT ST_Transform(rast,26918) AS rast
              FROM nyc_dem LIMIT 1)
  SELECT r.rid, ST_Transform(r.rast, ref.rast) AS rast, r.filename
  FROM nyc_dem AS r, ref;

The above on my system took about 1.5 minutes.
For a larger data set it would take much longer.

The aforementioned examples used two variants of the :command:`ST_Transform` raster function.
The first was to get a reference raster that will be used to transform the other raster tiles to guarantee that all tiles
have the same alignment.  Note the second variant of :command:`ST_Transform` used doesn't even take an input SRID.
This is because the SRID and all the pixel scale and block sizes are read from the reference raster.
If you used `ST_Transform(rast, srid)` form, then all your rasters might come out with different alignment
making it impossible to apply an operation such as :command:`ST_Union` on them.

The only problem with the aforementioned :command:`ST_Transform`
approach is that when you transform, the transformed often exists in other tiles.
If you looked at the above output closely enough by outputting the convex hull of the rasters,
in the next example
you'd see annoying overlaps around the borders.

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT rast::geometry
    FROM nyc_dem_26918
    ORDER BY rid
  LIMIT 100;

viewed in pgAdmin would look something like:

.. image:: ./rasters/st_transform_overlaps.png


Using ST_MakeEmptyCoverage to create even tiled rasters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A better approach, albeit a bit slower, is to define your own coverage tile structure from scratch using
`ST_MakeEmptyCoverage <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_MakeEmptyCoverage.html>`_ and then find the intersecting tiles
for each new tile, and ST_Union these and then use `ST_Transform(ref, ST_Union...)` to create each tile.

For this we'll be using quite a few functions, we learned about earlier.

.. code-block:: sql

  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS nyc_dem_26918;
  CREATE TABLE nyc_dem_26918 AS
  SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY t.rast::geometry) AS rid,
    ST_Union(ST_Clip( ST_Transform( r.rast, t.rast, 'Bilinear' ), t.rast::geometry ), 'MAX') AS rast
  FROM (SELECT ST_Transform(
      ST_SetSRID(ST_Extent(rast::geometry),2263)
          , 26918) AS geom
        FROM nyc_dem
      ) AS g, ST_MakeEmptyCoverage(tilewidth => 256, tileheight => 256,
                    width => (ST_XMax(g.geom) - ST_XMin(g.geom))::integer,
                    height => (ST_YMax(g.geom) - ST_YMin(g.geom))::integer,
                    upperleftx => ST_XMin(g.geom),
                    upperlefty => ST_YMax(g.geom),
                    scalex =>  3.048,
                    scaley => -3.048,
                    skewx => 0., skewy => 0., srid => 26918) AS t(rast)
            INNER JOIN nyc_dem AS r
              ON ST_Transform(t.rast::geometry, 2263) && r.rast
  GROUP BY t.rast;


Repeating the same exercise as earlier:

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT rast::geometry
    FROM nyc_dem_26918
    ORDER BY rid
  LIMIT 100;

viewed in pgAdmin we no longer have overlaps:

.. image:: ./rasters/st_transform_nooverlaps.png

On my system this took ~10 minutes and returned 3879 rows.
After the creation of the table, we'll want to do the usual of adding
a spatial index, primary key, and constraints as follows:

.. code-block:: sql

  ALTER TABLE nyc_dem_26918
    ADD CONSTRAINT pk_nyc_dem_26918 PRIMARY KEY(rid);

  CREATE INDEX ix_nyc_dem_26918_st_convexhull_gist
      ON nyc_dem_26918 USING gist( ST_ConvexHull(rast) );

  SELECT AddRasterConstraints('nyc_dem_26918'::name, 'rast'::name);
  ANALYZE nyc_dem_26918;

Which should take under 2 minutes for this dataset.

Creating overview tables with ST_CreateOverview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just as with our original dataset, it would be useful to have overview tables
to speed up performance of some operations.
`ST_CreateOverview <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_CreateOverview.html>`_ is a function fit for that purpose.
You can use :command:`ST_CreateOverview` to create overviews also
if you neglected to create one during the raster2pgsql load or  you decided, you need more overviews.

We'll create level 2 and 3 overviews as we had done with our original using this code.

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT ST_CreateOverview('nyc_dem_26918'::regclass, 'rast', 2);
  SELECT ST_CreateOverview('nyc_dem_26918'::regclass, 'rast', 3);

This process sadly takes a while, and a longer while the more rows you have so be patient.
For this dataset it took about 3-5 minutes for the overview factor `2` and 1 minute for the overview factor `3`.

The :command:`ST_CreateOverView` function also adds in the needed constraints so the columns appear with full detail in the
`raster_columns` and `raster_overviews` catalogs. It does not add indexes to them though and also does not add an rid column.
The rid column is probably not necessary unless you need a primary key to edit with. You would probably want an index
which you can create with the following:

.. code-block:: sql

  CREATE INDEX ix_o_2_nyc_dem_26918_st_convexhull_gist
      ON o_2_nyc_dem_26918 USING gist( ST_ConvexHull(rast) );

  CREATE INDEX ix_o_3_nyc_dem_26918_st_convexhull_gist
      ON o_3_nyc_dem_26918 USING gist( ST_ConvexHull(rast) );

.. note::

  ST_CreateOverview has an optional argument for denoting the sampling method.
  If not specified it uses the default `NearestNeighbor` which is generally the fastest to compute
  but may not be ideal. Resampling methods is beyond the scope of this workshop.


The intersection of rasters and geometries
-------------------------------------------
There are a couple of functions commonly used to compute intersections of
rasters and geometries.
We've already seen :command:`ST_Clip` in action which returns the intersection of a raster and geometry
as a raster, but there are others. For point data, the most commonly used is :command:`ST_Value`
and then there is the :command:`ST_Intersection`
which has several overloads some returning rasters and some returning a set of `geomval`.

Pixel values at a geometric Point
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to return values from rasters based on intersection of several ad-hoc geometry points,
you'll use `ST_Value <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_Value.html>`_
or it's nearest relative `ST_NearestValue <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_NearestValue.html>`_.

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT g.geom, ST_Value(r.rast, g.geom) AS elev
    FROM nyc_dem_26918 AS r
      INNER JOIN
      (SELECT id, geom
        FROM nyc_homicides
        WHERE weapon = 'gun') AS g
        ON r.rast && g.geom;

This example takes about 1 second to return 2444 rows.
If you used :command:`ST_Intersects` instead of :command:`&&`, the process would take about 3 seconds.
The reason `ST_Intersects` is slower is that it performs an additional recheck in some cases a pixel by pixel check.
If you expect all your points to be represented with data in your raster set and your rasters represent a coverage (a continguous set non-overlapping raster tiles), then `&&` is generally a speedier option.

If your raster data is not densely populated or you have overlapping rasters
(e.g. they represent different observations in time), or they are skewed (not axis aligned)
then there is an advantage to having ST_Intersects weed out the false positives.


ST_Intersection raster style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just as you can compute the intersection of two geometries using :command:`ST_Intersection`,
you can compute intersection of two rasters or a raster and a geometry
using `raster ST_Intersection <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_Intersection.html>`_.

What you get out of this beast, are two different kinds of things:

* Intersect a geometry with a raster, and you get a set of `geomval` offspring.
  Perhaps one, but most often many.

* Intersect 2 rasters and you get a single `raster` back.

The golden rule for both raster intersection and geometry intersection
is that both parties involved must have the same spatial reference system.
For raster/raster, they also have to have same alignment.

Here is an example which answers a question you may have been curious about.
If we bucket our elevations into 5 buckets of elevation values,
which elevation range results in the most gun fatalities?
We know based on our earlier summary statistics
that `0` is the lowest value and `411` is the highest value for elevation in our nyc dem dataset,
so we use that as min and max value for our `width_bucket <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-math.html>`_ call.

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT ST_Transform(ST_Union(gv.geom),4326) AS geom ,
    MIN(gv.val) AS min_elev, MAX(gv.val) AS max_elev,
      count(g.id) AS count_guns
    FROM nyc_dem_26918 AS r
      INNER JOIN nyc_homicides AS g
        ON ST_Intersects(r.rast, g.geom)
      CROSS JOIN
       ST_Intersection( g.geom,
        ST_Clip(r.rast,ST_Expand(g.geom, 4) )
        ) AS gv
    WHERE g.weapon = 'gun'
    GROUP BY width_bucket(gv.val, 0, 411, 5)
    ORDER BY width_bucket(gv.val, 0, 411, 5);

Is there an important correlation between gun homicides and elevation?
Probably not.


Let's take a look at raster / raster intersection:

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT ST_Intersection(r1.rast, 1, r2.rast, 1, 'BAND1')
    FROM nyc_dem_26918 AS r1
      INNER JOIN
          rasters AS r2 ON ST_Intersects(r1.rast,1, r2.rast, 1);

What we get are two rows with NULLLs, and if you have your PostgreSQL set to show notices, you'll see:

**NOTICE:  The two rasters provided do not have the same alignment.  Returning NULL**

In order to fix this, we can align one to the other as it's coming out of the gate using
`ST_Resample <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_Resample.html>`_.

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT ST_Intersection(r1.rast, 1,
    ST_Resample( r2.rast, r1.rast ), 1,
      'BAND1')
    FROM nyc_dem_26918 AS r1
      INNER JOIN
          rasters AS r2 ON ST_Intersects(r1.rast,1, r2.rast, 1);

Let's also roll it up into a single stats record

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT (
    ST_SummaryStatsAgg(
      ST_Intersection(r1.rast, 1,
        ST_Resample( r2.rast, r1.rast ), 1, 'BAND1'),
          1, true)
      ).*
    FROM nyc_dem_26918 AS r1
      INNER JOIN
          rasters AS r2 ON ST_Intersects(r1.rast,1, r2.rast, 1);

which outputs:

.. code-block:: sql

  count  |  sum  |      mean       |      stddev      | min | max
  -------+-------+-----------------+------------------+-----+-----
    2075 | 99536 | 47.969156626506 | 9.57974836865737 |  33 |  62
  (1 row)


Map Algebra Functions
----------------------
Map algebra is the idea that you can do math on your pixel values.
The :command:`ST_Union` and :command:`ST_Intersection` functions
covered earlier are a special fast case of map algebra.
Then there are
the `ST_MapAlgebra <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_MapAlgebra.html>`_
family of functions which allow you to define your own
crazy math, but at cost of performance.

People have the habit of jumping to  :command:`ST_MapAlgebra`,
probably because the name sounds so cool and sophisticated.
Who wouldn't want to tell their friends? *I'm using a function called ST_MapAlgebra.*
My advice, explore other functions before you pull out that shotgun.
Your life will be simpler and your performance will be 100 times better, and your code will be shorter.

Before we showcase `ST_MapAlgebra`, we'll explore other functions that fit under the `Map Algebra` family of functions
and generally have better performance than `ST_MapAlgebra`.

Reclassify your raster using ST_Reclass
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An often overlooked map-algebraish
function is the `ST_Reclass <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_Reclass.html>`_ function, who sits in the background
waiting for someone to discover the power and speed it can offer.

What does **ST_Reclass** do? It as the name implies, reclassifies your pixel values based on minimalist range algebra.

Lets revisit our NYC Dems.  Perhaps we only care about classifying our elevations as 1) low, 2) medium, 3) high , and 4) really high.
We don't need 411 values, we just need 4.  With that said lets do some reclassifying.

The classification scheme is governed by the `reclass expression <https://postgis.net/docs/reclassarg.html>`_.

.. code-block:: sql

  WITH r AS ( SELECT ST_Union(newrast) As rast
    FROM nyc_dem_26918 AS r
          INNER JOIN ST_Buffer(ST_Point(586598, 4504816, 26918), 1000 ) AS g(geom)
            ON ST_Intersects( r.rast, g.geom )
          CROSS JOIN ST_Reclass( ST_Clip(r.rast,g.geom), 1,
            '[0-10):1, [10-50):2, [50-100):3,[100-:4','4BUI',0) AS newrast
          )
  SELECT SUM(ST_Area(gv.geom)::numeric(10,2)) AS area, gv.val
      FROM r, ST_DumpAsPolygons(rast) AS gv
      GROUP BY gv.val
      ORDER BY gv.val;

Which would output:

.. code-block::

    area      | val
  ------------+-----
      6754.04 |   1
  1753117.51  |   2
  1355232.37  |   3
      1848.75 |   4
  (4 rows)

If this were a classification scheme we preferred, we could create a new table using the ST_Reclass to recompute each tile.

Coloring your rasters with ST_ColorMap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The `ST_ColorMap <https://postgis.net/docs/RT_ST_ColorMap.html>`_ function is another mapalgebraish function
that reclassifies your pixel values.  Except it is band creating. It converts a single band raster such as our Dems
into a visually presentable 3 or 4 banded raster.

You could use one of the built-in colormaps as below if you don't want to fuss with creating one.

.. code-block:: sql

 SELECT ST_ColorMap( ST_Union(newrast), 'bluered') As rast
    FROM nyc_dem_26918 AS r
        INNER JOIN
          ST_Buffer(
            ST_Point(586598, 4504816, 26918), 1000
            ) AS g(geom)
        ON ST_Intersects( r.rast, g.geom)
         CROSS JOIN ST_Clip(rast, g.geom) AS newrast;

Which looks like:

.. image:: ./rasters/st_colormap_ny_dem.png

The bluer the color the lower the elevation and the redder the color the higher the elevation.
