"PostgreSQL has a rich and flexible permissions system, with the ability to "
"parcel out particular privileges to particular roles_, and provide users "
"with the powers of one or more of those roles_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:8
msgid ""
"In addition, the PostgreSQL server can use multiple different systems to "
"authenticate users. This means that the database can use the same "
"authentication infrastructure as other architecture components, simplifying "
"password management."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:12
msgid "Users and Roles"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:14
msgid "In this chapter we will create two useful production users:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:16
msgid "A read-only user for use in a publishing application."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:17
msgid ""
"A read/write user for use by a developer in building a software or analyzing "
"data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:19
msgid ""
"Rather than creating users and granting them the necessary powers, we will "
"create two roles with the right powers and then create two users and add "
"them to the appropriate roles. That way we can easily reuse the roles when "
"we create further users."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:23
msgid "Creating Roles"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:25
msgid ""
"A role is a user and a user is a role. The only difference is that a \"user"
"\" can be said to be a role with the \"login\" privilege."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:27
msgid ""
"So functionally, the two SQL statements below are the same, they both create "
"a \"role with the login privilege\", which is to say, a \"user\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:36
msgid "Read-only Users"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:38
msgid ""
"Our read-only user will be for a web application to use to query the "
"``nyc_streets`` table."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:40
msgid ""
"The application will have specific access to the ``nyc_streets`` table, but "
"will inherit the necessary system access for PostGIS operations from the "
"``postgis_reader`` role."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:54
msgid ""
"Now, when we login as app1, we can select rows from the ``nyc_streets`` "
"table. However, we cannot run an :command:`ST_Transform` call! Why not?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:70
msgid ""
"The answer is contained in the error statement. Though our ``app1`` user can "
"view the contents of the ``nyc_streets`` table fine, it cannot view the "
"contents of ``spatial_ref_sys``, so the call to :command:`ST_Transform` "
"fails."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:72
msgid ""
"So, we need to also grant the ``postgis_reader`` role read access to all the "
"PostGIS metadata tables:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:80
msgid ""
"Now we have a nice generic ``postgis_reader`` role we can apply to any user "
"that need to read from PostGIS tables."
msgstr ""

msgid "Read/write Users"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:93

msgid "Web applications and others that need to write to existing data tables."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:96
msgid ""
"Developers or analysts that need to create new tables and geometry columns "
"as part of their work."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:98
msgid ""
"For web applications that require write access to data tables, we just need "
"to grant extra permissions to the tables themselves, and we can continue to "
"use the ``postgis_reader`` role."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:105
msgid ""
"These kinds of permissions would be required for a read/write WFS service, "
"for example."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:107
msgid ""
"For developers and analysts, a little more access is needed to the main "
"PostGIS metadata tables.  We will need a ``postgis_writer`` role that can "
"edit the PostGIS metadata tables!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:123
msgid ""
"Now try the table creation SQL above as the app1 user and see how it goes!"

"some of them on by default."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:131
msgid ""
"By default, all passwords are MD5 encrypted. The client/server handshake "

msgid "SSL Connections"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:138
msgid ""
"In order to use SSL connections, both your client and server must support "

#: ../../en/security.rst:140
msgid ""
"First, turn off PostgreSQL, since activating SSL will require a restart."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:141
msgid ""
"Next, we acquire or generate an SSL certificate and key. The certificate "
"will need to have no passphrase on it, or the database server won't be able "
"to start up. You can generate a self-signed key as follows:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:157

"Copy the ``server.crt`` and ``server.key`` into the PostgreSQL data "

msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:163

"With the server enabled for SSL, creating an encrypted connection is easy. "
"In PgAdmin, create a new server connection (File > Add Server...), and set "
"the SSL parameter to “require”."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:167
msgid ""
"Once you connect with the new connection, you can see in its properties that "
"it is using an SSL connection."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:171
msgid ""
"Since the default SSL connection mode is \"prefer\", you don't even need to "
"specify an SSL preference when connecting. A connection with the command "

msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:189
msgid ""
"First, enable pgcrypto by loading the contrib SQL file, either in PgAdmin or "
"psql."

msgid ""
"PostgreSQL supports many different `authentication methods <http://www."
"postgresql.org/docs/current/static/auth-methods.html>`_, to allow easy "
"integration into existing enterprise architectures. For production purposes, "
"the following methods are commonly used:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:216
msgid ""
"**Password** is the basic system where the passwords are stored by the "
"database, with MD5 encryption."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:217
msgid ""
"Kerberos_ is a standard enterprise authentication method, which is used by "
"both the GSSAPI_ and SSPI_ schemes in PostgreSQL. Using SSPI_, PostgreSQL "
"can authenticate against Windows servers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:218
msgid ""
"LDAP_ is another common enterprise authentication method. The `OpenLDAP "
"<http://www.openldap.org/>`_ server bundled with most Linux distributions "
"provides an open source implementation of LDAP_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:219
msgid ""
"**Certificate** authentication is an option if you expect all client "
"connections to be via SSL and are able to manage the distribution of keys."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:220
msgid ""
"PAM_ authentication is an option if you are on Linux or Solaris and use the "
"PAM_ scheme for transparent authentication provision."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:222
msgid ""
"Authentication methods are controlled by the ``pg_hba.conf`` file. The \"HBA"
"\" in the file name stands for \"host based access\", because in addition to "
"allowing you to specify the authentication method to use for each database, "
"it allows you to limit host access using network addresses."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:224
msgid "Here is an example ``pg_hba.conf`` file:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:239
msgid "The file consists of five columns"

"**TYPE** determines the kind of access, either \"local\" for connections "
"from the same server or \"host\" for remote connections."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:242
msgid ""
"**DATABASE** specifies what database the configuration line refers to or "
"\"all\" for all databases"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:243
msgid ""
"**USER** specifies what users the line refers to or \"all\" for all users"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:244
msgid ""
"**CIDR-ADDRESS** specifies the network limitations for remote connections, "
"using network/netmask syntax"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:245
msgid ""
"**METHOD** specifies the authentication protocol to use. \"trust\" skips "
"authentication entirely and simply accepts any valid username without "
"challenge."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:247
msgid ""
"It's common for local connections to be trusted, since access to the server "
"itself is usually privileged. Remote connections are disabled by default "
"when PostgreSQL is installed: if you want to connect from remote machines, "
"you'll have to add an entry."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/security.rst:249
msgid ""
"The line for ``nyc`` in the example above is an example of a remote access "
"entry. The ``nyc`` example allows LDAP authenticated access only to machines "
"on the local network (in this case the 192.168.1. network) and only to the "
"nyc database. Depending on the security of your network, you will use more "
"or less strict versions of these rules in your production set-up."
