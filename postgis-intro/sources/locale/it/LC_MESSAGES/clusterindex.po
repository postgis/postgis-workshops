"Databases can only retrieve information as fast as they can get it off of "
"disk. Small databases will float up entirely into RAM cache, and get away "
"from physical disk limitations, but for large databases, access to the "
"physical disk will be a limiting stop in disk access speed."

"Data is written to disk opportunistically, so there is not necessarily any "
"correlation between the order data is stored on the disk and the way it will "
"be accessed or organized by applications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/clusterindex.rst:13
msgid ""
"One way to speed up access to data is to ensure that records which is likely "
"to be retrieved together in the same result set are located in similar "
"physical locations on the hard disk platters. This is called \"clustering\"."

#: ../../en/clusterindex.rst:15
msgid ""
"The right clustering scheme to use can be tricky, but a general rule "
"applies: indexes define a natural ordering scheme for data which is similar "
"to the access pattern that will be used in retrieving the data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/clusterindex.rst:20
msgid ""
"Because of this, ordering the data on the disk in the same order as the "
"index can provide a speed advantage in some cases."

"Spatial data tends to be accessed in spatially correlated windows: think of "
"the map window in a web or desktop application. All the data in the windows "
"has similar location value (or it wouldn't be in the window!)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/clusterindex.rst:27
msgid ""
"So, clustering based on a spatial index makes sense for spatial data that is "
"going to be accessed with spatial queries: similar things tend to have "
"similar locations."

msgid "Let's cluster our ``nyc_census_blocks`` based on their spatial index:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/clusterindex.rst:36
msgid ""
"The command re-writes the ``nyc_census_blocks`` in the order defined by the "
"spatial index ``nyc_census_blocks_geom_gist``. Can you perceive a speed "
"difference? Probably not, because the table is quite small and easily fits "
"into memory, so disk access overhead doesn't affect performance."

#: ../../en/clusterindex.rst:38

"One of the surprises of the R-Tree is that an R-Tree built incrementally on "
"spatial data might not have high spatial coherence of the leaves. For "
"example, see this visualization of the spatial index leaves of an index on "
"roads in the province of British Columbia."

msgid ""
"We would prefer to cluster using a more spatially compact tree, like this "
"balanced R-Tree."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/clusterindex.rst:48
msgid ""
"We don't have a balanced R-Tree algorithm available in PostGIS, but we do "
"have a useful proxy that puts spatial data into a spatially autocorrelated "
"order, the **ST_GeoHash()** function."

msgid "Clustering on GeoHash"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/clusterindex.rst:53
msgid ""
"To cluster on the ST_GeoHash() function, you first need to have a geohash "
"index on your data. Fortunately, they are easy to build."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/clusterindex.rst:55
msgid ""
"The geohash algorithm only works on data in geographic (longitude/latitude) "
"coordinates, so we need to transform the geometries (to EPSG:4326, which is "
"longitude/latitude) at the same time as we hash them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/clusterindex.rst:61
msgid ""
"Once you have a geohash index, clustering on it uses the same syntax as the "
"R-Tree clustering."
