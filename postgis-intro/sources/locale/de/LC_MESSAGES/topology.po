msgid "PostGIS supports the SQL/MM SQL-MM 3 Topo-Geo and Topo-Net 3 specifications via an extension called **postgis_topology**. You can learn about all the functions and types provided by this extension in `Manual: PostGIS Topology <https://postgis.net/docs/Topology.html>`_. The *postgis_topology* extension includes another kind of core spatial type, called a **topogeometry**. In addition to the *topogeometry* spatial type, you will find functions for building *topologies* and populating topologies."

Before we explain, let's start by creating a topology to house our NYC topologically perfect data using the `CreateTopology <https://postgis.net/docs/CreateTopology.html>`_ function and set the tolerance to be 0.5 meters. Note the 0.5 is in meters since our spatial reference system is State Plany NY meters."

#: ../../en/topology.rst:87
msgid "Where does a topogeometry reside?  It resides somewhere else which references elements of a topology via the *relation* table. Although we could throw the topogeometries in our `nyc_topo` schema, the general convention, is to define other tables in other schemas that have a topogeometry, and also have any other kind of data you might be interested in tracking."

msgid "Why use topogeometries?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/topology.rst:94
msgid "Using topogeometries keeps your data tidy and connected. Topogeometries are very useful for Cadastral work, where you want to make sure two parcels of land don't overlap each other even if you change the boundaries of one or you want to make sure roads stay connected as you change the geometries that form them. Geometries live in an island of their own, you can duplicate them, morph them. Geometries are carefree, not caring about other geometries that share space with them. Topogeometries, in contrast, follow the rules of their topology; they can't exist unless there is an edge, node, face, or other topogeometry that defines them. A topogeometry belongs to one and only one topology. A topogeometry is a relational model of a geometry and as such as each component (edges/faces/nodes) are moved, added etc, they change not one topogeometry shape, but all topogeometries that have components in common."

#: ../../en/topology.rst:109
msgid "Edges, Faces, and Nodes can be formed by creating topogeometries. When a topogeometry is created from a geometry and their are missing edges, faces, or nodes that match its coordinates, then new edges, faces, and nodes are created as part of the process."

msgid "The most common way to populate topologies is to create topogeometries. Lets start by creating a table to hold neighborhoods and then add a topogeometry column using the `AddTopoGeometryColumn <https://postgis.net/docs/AddTopoGeometryColumn.html>`_ function."

#: ../../en/topology.rst:128
msgid "The output of the above is:"

msgid "Now we are ready to populate our table. It's best to ensure your geometries are valid before adding, otherwise you'll get errors such as SQL\\MM geometry is not simple."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/topology.rst:140
msgid "So lets start by adding valid ones.  The 1 used here refers to the layer_id generated from the previous query. If you don't know the layer id, you would look it up using the `FindLayer <https://postgis.net/docs/FindLayer.html>`_ function which we'll use in later examples."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/topology.rst:144
msgid "For these examples you'll use the function `toTopoGeom <https://postgis.net/docs/toTopoGeom.html>`_ function to convert a geometry to it's topogeometry equivalent.  toTopoGeom function handles a lot of book-keeping for you."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/topology.rst:147
msgid "The `toTopoGeom` function inspects the geometry passed in and injects nodes, edges, and faces as needed into your topology to form the shape of the geometry.  It will then add relationships to the `relation` table that defines how this new topogeometry is related to these new and existing topology elements. In some cases pieces of the geometry may exist or existing pieces need to be split to form the new geometry."

#: ../../en/topology.rst:157
msgid "The above step should take 3-4 secs. Now lets add the invalid ones:"

msgstr ""

#: ../../en/topology.rst:221
msgid "In order to populate this new table, we'll use the `CreateTopoGeom <https://postgis.net/docs/CreateTopoGeom.html>`_ function.

#: ../../en/topology.rst:239
msgid "If you are using PostGIS 3.4 or higher, you can use the new cast to cast a topogeometry to a topoelement, and replace `topology.TopoElementArray_Agg( ARRAY[ (n.topo).id, (n.topo).layer_id ]::topoelement ) )` in the above example with the shorter `topology.TopoElementArray_Agg( n.topo::topoelement )`"

msgid "If you are thinking, what a total mess, yes it is a total mess. This is what happens after numerous cycles of simplification and other geometry processes where each geometry is treated as a separate unit.  You get gaps, you get dangling islands, and neighborhoods encroaching on each other's territory."

msgstr ""

#: ../../en/topology.rst:263
msgid "Let's put our land surveyor hat on and ask the question, if we are dividing our plots of land into districts (boros or neighborhoods) such that each district may border other districts but should not share any area in common, does it make sense for districts to have areas in common?  No it does not make sense. And here we are with our data pointing out some areas belong to more than one neighborhood or more than one borough."

msgid "Which tells us that Queens and Brooklyn are in the middle of border wars. In this query we use the  `GetTopoGeomElements <https://postgis.net/docs/GetTopoGeomElements.html>`_ function to declaratively inspect what components are shared across boroughs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/topology.rst:296
msgid "What is returned are a set of topolements.  A topoelement is represented as an array of 2 integers with the first number being the id of the element, and the second, being the layer (or primitive type) of the element. PostGIS GetTopoElements returns the primitives of a topogeometry with types number 1-3 corresponding to (1: nodes, 2: edges, and 3: faces). All the topoelements for neighborhoods and boroughs are type 3, which corresponds to a topological face. We can use the `ST_GetFaceGeometry <https://postgis.net/docs/ST_GetFaceGeometry.html>`_ to get a visual representation of these shared faces as follows:"

#: ../../en/topology.rst:324
msgid "Because boroughs are an aggregation of neighborhoods, we can fix the borough issue by fixing the neighborhood border disputes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/topology.rst:327
msgid "There are a number of ways we could fix this. We could go out surveying asking people what neighbhood do they think they are standing in.  Alternatively we could just assign slivers of land to the neighborhood with the least amount of area or to the highest bidder."

#: ../../en/topology.rst:331
msgid "Removing elements from Topogeometries is handled using the `TopoGeom_remElement <https://postgis.net/docs/TopoGeom_remElement.html>`_ function.  So lets get on with it, removing duplicaed elements from neighborhoods with the most amount of area as follows:"

#: ../../en/topology.rst:346
msgid "The result of the above is 29 neighborhoods were updated. If you rerun the border dispute queries for neighborhoods and boroughs, you'll find you have no more border disputes."
msgstr ""

msgid "We do still have gaps of empty space between neighborhoods caused by intensive simplification. Such issues can be fixed by directly editing the topology using the `Topology Editor family of functions <https://postgis.net/docs/Topology.html#Topology_Editing>`_ and/or filling in the holes and assigning those to neighborhoods."
