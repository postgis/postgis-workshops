"Linear referencing (sometimes called \"dynamic segmentation\") is a means of "
"representing features that can be described by referencing a base set of "
"linear features. Common examples of features that are modelled using linear "
"referencing are:"

"The benefit of linear referencing models is that the dependent spatial "
"observations do not need to be separately recorded from the base "
"observations, and updates to the base observation layer can be carried out "
"knowing that the dependent observations will automatically track the new "
"geometry."

"The Esri terminological convention for linear referencing is to have a base "
"table of linear spatial features, and a non-spatial table of \"events\" "
"which includes a foreign key reference to the spatial feature and a measure "
"along the referenced feature. We will use the term \"event table\" to refer "
"to the non-spatial tables we build."

"If you have an existing point table that you want to reference to a linear "
"network, use the :command:`ST_LineLocatePoint` function, which takes a line "
"and point, and returns the proportion along the line that the point can be "
"found."

"We can convert the **nyc_subway_stations** into an \"event table\" relative "
"to the streets by using :command:`ST_LineLocatePoint`."

"Once we have an event table, it's fun to turn it back into a spatial view, "
"so we can visualize the events relative to the original points they were "
"derived from."

"And we can join the **nyc_subway_station_events** tables back to the "
"**nyc_streets** table and use the **measure** attribute to generate the "
"spatial event points, without referencing the original "
"**nyc_subway_stations** table."

"Viewing the original (red star) and event (blue circle) points with the "

"One surprising use of the linear referencing functions has nothing to do "
"with linear referencing models. As shown above, it's possible to use the "
"functions to snap points to linear features. For use cases like GPS tracks "
"or other inputs that are expected to reference a linear network, snapping is "
"a handy feature to have available."
