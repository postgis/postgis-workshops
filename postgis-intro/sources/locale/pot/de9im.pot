msgid "The \"`Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM>`_\" (DE9IM) is a framework for modelling how two spatial objects interact."
msgstr ""

msgid "First, every spatial object has:"

msgid "An interior"

msgid "A boundary"

msgid "An exterior"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:14
msgid "For polygons, the interior, boundary and exterior are obvious:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:19
msgid "The interior is the part bounded by the rings; the boundary is the rings themselves; the exterior is everything else in the plane."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:21
msgid "For linear features, the interior, boundary and exterior are less well-known:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:26
msgid "The interior is the part of the line bounded by the ends; the boundary is the ends of the linear feature, and the exterior is everything else in the plane."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:28
msgid "For points, things are even stranger: the interior is the point; the boundary is the empty set and the exterior is everything else in the plane."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:30
msgid "Using these definitions of interior, exterior and boundary, the relationships between any pair of spatial features can be characterized using the dimensionality of the nine possible intersections between the interiors/boundaries/exteriors of a pair of objects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:35
msgid "For the polygons in the example above, the intersection of the interiors is a 2-dimensional area, so that portion of the matrix is filled out with a \"2\". The boundaries only intersect at points, which are zero-dimensional, so that portion of the matrix is filled out with a 0."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:37
msgid "When there is no intersection between components, the square the matrix is filled out with an \"F\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:39
msgid "Here's another example, of a linestring partially entering a polygon:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:44
msgid "The DE9IM matrix for the interaction is this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:49
msgid "Note that the boundaries of the two objects don't actually intersect at all (the end point of the line interacts with the interior of the polygon, not the boundary, and vice versa), so the B/B cell is filled in with an \"F\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:51
msgid "While it's fun to visually fill out DE9IM matrices, it would be nice if a computer could do it, and that's what the :command:`ST_Relate` function is for."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:53
msgid "The previous example can be simplified using a simple box and line, with the same spatial relationship as our polygon and linestring:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:58
msgid "And we can generate the DE9IM information in SQL:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:67
msgid "The answer (1010F0212) is the same as we calculated visually, but returned as a 9-character string, with the first row, second row and third row of the table appended together."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:75
msgid "However, the power of DE9IM matrices is not in generating them, but in using them as a matching key to find geometries with very specific relationships to one another."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:94
msgid "Suppose we have a data model that includes **Lakes** and **Docks**, and suppose further that Docks must be inside lakes, and must touch the boundary of their containing lake at one end. Can we find all the docks in our database that obey that rule?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:99
msgid "Our legal docks have the following characteristics:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:101
msgid "Their interiors have a linear (1D) intersection with the lake interior"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:102
msgid "Their boundaries have a point (0D) intersection with the lake interior"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:103
msgid "Their boundaries **also** have a point (0D) intersection with the lake boundary"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:104
msgid "Their interiors have no intersection (F) with the lake exterior"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:106
msgid "So their DE9IM matrix looks like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:111
msgid "So to find all the legal docks, we would want to find all the docks that intersect lakes (a super-set of **potential** candidates we use for our join key), and then find all the docks in that set which have the legal relate pattern."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:121
msgid "Note the use of the three-parameter version of :command:`ST_Relate`, which returns true if the pattern matches or false if it does not. For a fully-defined pattern like this one, the three-parameter version is not needed -- we could have just used a string equality operator."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:123
msgid "However, for looser pattern searches, the three-parameter allows substitution characters in the pattern string:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:125
msgid "\"*\" means \"any value in this cell is acceptable\""
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:126
msgid "\"T\" means \"any non-false value (0, 1 or 2) is acceptable\""
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:128
msgid "So for example, one possible dock we did not include in our example graphic is a dock with a two-dimensional intersection with the lake boundary:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:138
msgid "If we are to include this case in our set of \"legal\" docks, we need to change the relate pattern in our query. In particular, the intersection of the dock interior lake boundary can now be either 1 (our new case) or F (our original case). So we use the \"*\" catchall in the pattern."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:143
msgid "And the SQL looks like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:153
msgid "Confirm that the stricter SQL from the previous example does *not* return the new dock."

msgid "Data Quality Testing"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:159
msgid "The TIGER data is carefully quality controlled when it is prepared, so we expect our data to meet strict standards. For example: no census block should overlap any other census block. Can we test for that?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:164
msgid "Sure!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:177
msgid "Similarly, we would expect that the roads data is all end-noded. That is, we expect that intersections only occur at the ends of lines, not at the mid-points."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/de9im.rst:182
msgid "We can test for that by looking for streets that intersect (so we have a join) but where the intersection between the boundaries is not zero-dimensional (that is, the end points don't touch):"
