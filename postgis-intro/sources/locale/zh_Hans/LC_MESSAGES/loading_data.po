msgid "The postgis workshop data directory includes a :file:`2000/` sub-directory, which contains shape files from the 2000 census, that were obsoleted by data from the 2010 census. We can practice data loading using those files, to avoid creating name collisions with the data we already loaded using the backup file. Be sure to be in the :file:`2000/` sub-directory with the shell when doing these instructions:"

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:73
msgid "Note that on Windows, you will need to use ``set`` instead of ``export``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:88
msgid "For more visual clarity, these lines are displayed with ``\\``, but they should be written in one line on your shell."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:90
msgid "The :file:`ogr2ogr` has a **huge** number of options, and we're only using a handful of them here. Here is a line-by-line explanation of the command."

msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:102
msgid "The **nln** option stands for \"new layer name\", and sets the table name that will be created in the target database."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:108
msgid "The **nlt** option stands for \"new layer type\". For shape file input in particular, the new layer type is often a \"multi-part geometry\", so the system needs to be told in advance to use \"MultiPolygon\" instead of \"Polygon\" for the geometry type."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:116
msgid "The **lco** option stands for \"layer create option\". Different drivers have different create options, and we are using three options for the `PostgreSQL driver <https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/pg.html>`_ here."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:118
msgid "**GEOMETRY_NAME** sets the column name for the geometry column. We prefer \"geom\" over the default, so that our tables match the standard column names in the workshop."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:119
msgid "**FID** sets the primary key column name. Again we prefer \"gid\" which is the standard used in the workshop."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:120
msgid "**PRECISION** controls how numeric fields are represented in the database. The default when loading a shape file is to use the database \"numeric\" type, which is more precise but sometimes harder to work with than simple number types like \"integer\" and \"double precision\". We use \"NO\" to turn off the \"numeric\" type."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:126
msgid "The order of arguments in :file:`ogr2ogr` is, roughly: executable, then options, then **destination** location, then **source location**. So this is the destination, the connection string for our PostgreSQL database. The \"Pg:\" portion is the driver name, and then the `connection string <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING>`_ is contained in quotation marks (because it might have embedded spaces)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:132
msgid "The source data set in this case is the shape file we are reading. It is possible to read multiple layers in one invocation by putting the connection string here, and then following it with a list of layer names, but in this case we have just the one shape file to load."

msgid "Shapefiles? What's that?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:138
msgid "You may be asking yourself -- \"What's this shapefile thing?\"  A \"shapefile\" commonly refers to a collection of files with ``.shp``, ``.shx``, ``.dbf``, and other extensions on a common prefix name (e.g., nyc_census_blocks). The actual shapefile relates specifically to files with the ``.shp`` extension. However, the ``.shp`` file alone is incomplete for distribution without the required supporting files."

msgid "The :file:`shp2pgsql` utility makes shape data usable in PostGIS by converting it from binary data into a series of SQL commands that are then run in the database to load the data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:154
msgid "Loading with shp2pgsql"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:156
msgid "The :file:`shp2pgsql` converts Shape files into SQL. It is a conversion utility that is part of the PostGIS code base and ships with PostGIS packages. If you installed PostgreSQL locally on your computer, you may find that :file:`shp2pgsql` has been installed along with it, and it is available in the executable directory of your installation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:158
msgid "Unlike :file:`ogr2ogr`, :file:`shp2pgsql` does not connect directly to the destination database, it just emits the SQL equivalent to the input shape file. It is up to the user to pass the SQL to the database, either with a \"pipe\" or by saving the SQL to file and then loading it."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:186
msgid "The **D** flag tells the program to generate \"dump format\" which is much faster to load than the default \"insert format\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:192
msgid "The **I** flag tells the program to create a spatial index on the table after loading is complete."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:198
msgid "The **s** flag tells the program what the \"spatial reference identifier (SRID)\" of the data is. The source data for this workshop is all in \"UTM 18\", for which the SRID is **26918** (see below)."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:211
msgid "The table name to use when creating the destination table."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:217
msgid "The utility program is generating a stream of SQL. The \"|\" operator takes that stream and uses it as input to the :file:`psql` database terminal program. The arguments to :file:`psql` are just the connection string for the destination database."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:221
msgid "SRID 26918? What's with that?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:223
msgid "Most of the import process is self-explanatory, but even experienced GIS professionals can trip over an **SRID**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:225
msgid "An \"SRID\" stands for \"Spatial Reference IDentifier.\" It defines all the parameters of our data's geographic coordinate system and projection. An SRID is convenient because it packs all the information about a map projection (which can be quite complex) into a single number."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:239
msgid "The PostGIS ``spatial_ref_sys`` table is an :term:`OGC`-standard table that defines all the spatial reference systems known to the database. The data shipped with PostGIS, lists over 3000 known spatial reference systems and details needed to transform/re-project between them."

msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:266
msgid "Data you receive from local agencies—such as New York City—will usually be in a local projection noted by \"state plane\" or \"UTM\".  Our projection is \"Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 18 North\" or EPSG:26918."
