"The difference between the UTM 18 and the State Plane Long Island "
"measurements is (10421993 - 10418904)/10418904, or 0.02%. Calculated on the "
"spheroid using :ref:`geography` the total street length is 10421999, which "
"is closer to the State Plane value. This is not surprising, since the State "
"Plane Long Island projection is precisely calibrated for a very small area "
"(New York City) while UTM 18 has to provide reasonable results for a large "
"regional area."

"The \"74th meridian\" is a fancy way of saying \"a vertical line in "
"geographics where the X value is -74\". We can construct such a line and "
"then compare it to the streets, projected into geographics also. Projecting "
"the line into UTM and comparing it there will return a slightly different "
"answer. To get the same answer, you need to \"segmentize\" it, so it has "
"more points, before transforming."
