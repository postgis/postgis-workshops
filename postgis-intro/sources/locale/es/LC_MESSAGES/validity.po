"In 90% of the cases the answer to the question, \"why is my query giving me "
"a 'TopologyException' error\" is \"one or more of the inputs are invalid\".  "
"Which begs the question: what does it mean to be invalid, and why should we "
"care?"

msgid "What is Validity"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/validity.rst:11
msgid ""
"Validity is most important for polygons, which define bounded areas and "
"require a good deal of structure. Lines are very simple and cannot be "
"invalid, nor can points."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/validity.rst:13
msgid ""
"Some of the rules of polygon validity feel obvious, and others feel "
"arbitrary (and in fact, are arbitrary)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/validity.rst:15
msgid "Polygon rings must close."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/validity.rst:16
msgid ""
"Rings that define holes should be inside rings that define exterior "
"boundaries."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/validity.rst:17
msgid ""
"Rings may not self-intersect (they may neither touch nor cross themselves)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/validity.rst:18
msgid "Rings may not touch other rings, except at a point."

"The last three rules are in the arbitrary category. There are other ways to "
"define polygons that are equally self-consistent but the rules above are the "
"ones used by the :term:`OGC` :term:`SFSQL` standard that PostGIS conforms to."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/validity.rst:23
msgid ""
"The reason the rules are important is because algorithms for geometry "
"calculations depend on consistent structure in the inputs. It is possible to "
"build algorithms that have no structural assumptions, but those routines "
"tend to be very slow, because the first step in any structure-free routine "
"is to *analyze the inputs and build structure into them*."

"The outer ring is actually a figure-eight, with a self-intersection in the "
"middle. Note that the graphic routines successfully render the polygon fill, "
"so that visually it is appears to be an \"area\": two one-unit squares, so a "
"total area of two units of area."

msgid "Let's see what the database thinks the area of our polygon is:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/validity.rst:51
msgid ""
"What's going on here? The algorithm that calculates area assumes that rings "
"do not self-intersect. A well-behaved ring will always have the area that is "
"bounded (the interior) on one side of the bounding line (it doesn't matter "
"which side, just that it is on *one* side). However, in our (poorly behaved) "
"figure-eight, the bounded area is to the right of the line for one lobe and "
"to the left for the other. This causes the areas calculated for each lobe to "
"cancel out (one comes out as 1, the other as -1) hence the \"zero area\" "
"result."

"In the previous example we had one polygon that we **knew** was invalid. How "
"do we detect invalidity in a table with millions of geometries? With the :"

"get a quick answer:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/validity.rst:69

"Now we know that the feature is invalid, but we don't know why. We can use "
"the :command:`ST_IsValidReason(geometry)` function to find out the source of "
"the invalidity:"

"Note that in addition to the reason (self-intersection) the location of the "
"invalidity (coordinate (1 1)) is also returned."

msgid "Repairing Invalidity"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/validity.rst:106
msgid ""
"Repairing invalidity involves stripping a polygon down to its simplest "
"structures (rings), ensuring the rings follow the rules of validity, then "
"building up new polygons that follow the rules of ring enclosure. Frequently "
"the results are intuitive, but in the case of extremely ill-behaved inputs, "
"the valid outputs may not conform to your intuition of how they should look. "
"Recent versions of PostGIS include different algorithms for geometry repair: "
"read the `manual page <http://postgis.net/docs/ST_MakeValid.html>`_ "
"carefully and choose the one you like best."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/validity.rst:108
msgid ""
"For example, here's a classic invalidity -- the \"banana polygon\" -- a "
"single ring that encloses an area but bends around to touch itself, leaving "
"a \"hole\" which is not actually a hole."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/validity.rst:117
msgid ""
"Running `ST_MakeValid <http://postgis.net/docs/ST_MakeValid.html>`_ on the "
"polygon returns a valid :term:`OGC` polygon, consisting of an outer and "
"inner ring that touch at one point."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/validity.rst:133
msgid ""
"The \"banana polygon\" (or \"inverted shell\") is a case where the :term:"
"`OGC` topology model for valid geometry and the model used internally by "
"ESRI differ. The ESRI model considers rings that touch to be invalid, and "
"prefers the banana form for this kind of shape. The OGC model is the "
"reverse. Neither is \"correct\", they are just different ways to model the "
"same situation."
