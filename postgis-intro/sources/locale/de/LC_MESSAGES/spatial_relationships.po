"So far we have only used spatial functions that measure (:command:"
"`ST_Area`, :command:`ST_Length`), serialize (:command:`ST_GeomFromText`) or "
"deserialize (:command:`ST_AsGML`) geometries. What these functions have in "
"common is that they only work on one geometry at a time."

"The opposite of ST_Intersects is :command:`ST_Disjoint(geometry A , geometry "
