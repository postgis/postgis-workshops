"**PRECISION** controls how numeric fields are represented in the "

"use \"NO\" to turn off the \"numeric\" type."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/loading_data.rst:115

"The order of arguments in :file:`ogr2ogr` is, roughly: executable, then "
"options, then **destination** location, then **source location**. So this"
" is the destination, the connection string for our PostgreSQL database. "
"The \"Pg:\" portion is the driver name, and then the `connection string "

"You may be asking yourself -- \"What's this shapefile thing?\"  A "
"\"shapefile\" commonly refers to a collection of files with ``.shp``, "

"nyc_census_blocks). The actual shapefile relates specifically to files "

msgid ""
"Unlike :file:`ogr2ogr`, :file:`shp2pgsql` does not connect directly to "
