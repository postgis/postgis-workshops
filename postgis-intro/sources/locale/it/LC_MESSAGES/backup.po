"As discussed in :ref:`schemas`, ensuring that production data is always "

"data. There are two reasons:"
msgstr ""
"Come discusso in :ref:`schemas`, e' molto importante assicurarsi che i dati "
"di produzione siano sempre conservati in schemi separati. Ecco due motivi:"

#: ../../en/backup.rst:19

"Backing up and restoring data in schemas is much simpler than managing lists "

"Backing up a full database is easy using the pg_dump_ utility. The utility "
"is a command-line tool, which makes it easy to automate with scripting, and "
"it can also be invoke via a GUI in the PgAdmin utility."

#: ../../en/backup.rst:36
msgid ""
"Note that there are three backup format options: compress, tar and plain."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:38
msgid ""
"**Plain** is just a textual SQL file. This is the simplest format and in "
"many ways the most flexible, since it can be editing or altered easily and "
"then loaded back into a database, allowing offline changes to things like "
"ownership or other global information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:39
msgid ""
"**Tar** using a UNIX archive format to hold components of the dump in "
"separate files. Using the tar format allows the pg_restore_ utility to "
"selectively restore parts of the dump."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:40
msgid ""
"**Compress** is like the Tar format, but compresses the internal components "
"individually, allowing them to be selectively restored without decompressing "
"the entire archive."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:42
msgid "We'll check the Compress option and go, saving out a backup file."

msgid "The same operation can be done with the command line like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:50

"Because the backup file is in Compress format, we can view the contents "

"\"View\" is an option in the panel."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:54
msgid ""
"When you look at the manifest, one of the things you might notice is that "
"there are a lot of \"FUNCTION\" signatures in there."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:58
msgid ""
"That's because the pg_dump_ utility dumps **every** non-system object in the "
"database, and that includes the PostGIS function definitions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:62
msgid ""
"PostgreSQL 9.1+ includes an \"EXTENSION\" feature that allows add-on "
"packages like PostGIS to be installed as registered system components and "
"therefore excluded from pg_dump_ output. PostGIS 2.0 and higher support "
"installation using this extension system."

"The problem with a dump file full of PostGIS function signatures is that we "
"really wanted a dump of our data, not our system functions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:72
msgid ""
"Since every object is in the dump file, we can restore to a blank database "
"and get full functionality. In doing so, we are expecting that system we are "
"restoring to has exactly the same version of PostGIS as the one we dumped "
"from (since the function signature definitions reference a particular "
"version of the PostGIS shared library)."

msgid "From the command-line the restore looks like this:"

"Dumping just data, without function signatures, is where having data in "
"schemas is handy, because there is a command-line flag to only dump a "

"Now when we list the contents of the dump, we see just the data tables we "
"wanted::"

msgid "Backing Up Users"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:122
msgid ""
"The pg_dump_ utility operates a database at a time (or a schema or table at "
"a time, if you restrict it). However, information about users is is stored "
"across an entire cluster, it's not stored in any one database!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:124
msgid ""
"To backup your user information, use the pg_dumpall_ utility, with the \"--"
"globals-only\" flag."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:130
msgid ""
"You can also use pg_dumpall_ in its default mode to backup an entire "
"cluster, but be aware that, as with pg_dump_, you will end up backing up the "
"PostGIS function signatures, so the dump will have to be restored against an "
"identical software installation, it can't be used as part of an upgrade "
"process."

msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:136
msgid ""
"Online backup and restore allows an administrator to keep an extremely up-to-"
"date set of backup files without the overhead of repeatedly dumping the "
"entire database. If the database is under frequent insert and update load, "
"then online backup might be preferable to basic backup."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:140
msgid ""
"The best way to learn about online backup is to read the relevant sections "
"of the PostgreSQL manual on `continuous archiving and point-in-time recovery "
"<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/continuous-archiving.html>`_. "
"This section of the PostGIS workshop will just provide a brief snapshot of "
"online backup set-up."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:144
msgid "How it Works"
msgstr "Come funziona"

#: ../../en/backup.rst:146
msgid ""
"Rather than continually write to the main data tables, PostgreSQL stores "
"changes initially in \"write-ahead logs\" (WAL). Taken together, these logs "
"are a complete record of all changes made to a database.  Online backup "
"consists of taking a copy of the database main data table, then taking a "
"copy of each WAL that is generated from then on."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:150
msgid ""
"When it is time to recover to a new database, the system starts on the main "
"data copy, then replays all the WAL files into the database. The end result "
"is a restored database in the same state as the original at the time of the "
"last WAL received."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:152
msgid ""
"Because WAL are being written anyways, and transferring copies to an archive "
"server is computationally cheap, online backup is an effective means of "
"keeping a very up-to-date backup of a system without resorting to intensive "
"regular full dumps."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:156
msgid "Archiving the WAL Files"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:158
msgid ""
"The first thing to do in setting up online backup is to create an archiving "
"method. PostgreSQL archiving methods are the ultimate in flexibility: the "
"PostgreSQL backend simply calls a script specified in the "
"``archive_command`` configuration parameter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:160
msgid ""
"That means archiving can be as simple as copying the file to a network-"
"mounted drive, and as complex as encrypting and emailing the files to the "
"remote archive. Any process you can script you can use to archive the files."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:162
msgid ""
"To turn on archiving we will edit ``postgresql.conf``, first turning on WAL "
"archiving:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:169
msgid ""
"And then setting the ``archive_command`` to copy our archive files to a safe "
"location (changing the destination paths as appropriate):"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:179
msgid ""
"It is important that the archive command not over-write existing files, so "
"the unix command includes an initial test to ensure that the files aren't "
"already there. It is also important that the command returns a non-zero "
"status if the copy process fails."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:181
msgid ""
"Once the changes are made you can re-start PostgreSQL to make them effective."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:185
msgid "Taking the Base Backup"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:187
msgid ""
"Once the archiving process is in place, you need to take a base back-up."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:189
msgid ""
"Put the database into backup mode (this doesn't do anything to alter "
"operation of queries or data updates, it just forces a checkpoint and writes "
"a label file indicating when the backup was taken)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:195
msgid ""
"For the label, using the path to the backup file is a good practice, as it "
"helps you track down where the backup was stored."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:197
msgid "Copy the database to an archival location:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:204
msgid "Then tell the database the backup process is complete."

#: ../../en/backup.rst:219
msgid ""
"If you have the space to do so, copy the whole cluster data directory and "
"any tablespaces to a temporary location in case you need them later. Note "
"that this precaution will require that you have enough free space on your "
"system to hold two copies of your existing database. If you do not have "
"enough space, you should at least save the contents of the cluster's pg_xlog "
"subdirectory, as it might contain logs which were not archived before the "
"system went down."

"Restore the database files from your file system backup. Be sure that they "
"are restored with the right ownership (the database system user, not root!) "

msgstr ""

#: ../../en/backup.rst:222
msgid ""
"Remove any files present in pg_xlog/; these came from the file system backup "
"and are therefore probably obsolete rather than current. If you didn't "

"set up that way before."

"If you have unarchived WAL segment files that you saved in step 2, copy them "
