"A common need when composing a spatial query is to replace a polygon feature "
"with a point representation of the feature. This is useful for spatial joins "
"(as discussed in :ref:`polypolyjoins`) because using :command:"
"`ST_Intersects(geometry,geometry)` on two polygon layers often results in "
"double-counting: a polygon on a boundary will intersect an object on both "
"sides; replacing it with a point forces it to be on one side or the other, "
"not both."

#: ../../en/geometry_returning.rst:21
msgid ""
":command:`ST_Centroid(geometry)` returns a point that is approximately on "
"the center of mass of the input argument. This simple calculation is very "
"fast, but sometimes not desirable, because the returned point is not "
"necessarily in the feature itself. If the input feature has a convexity "
"(imagine the letter 'C') the returned centroid might not be in the interior "
"of the feature."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/geometry_returning.rst:22
msgid ""
":command:`ST_PointOnSurface(geometry)` returns a point that is guaranteed to "
"be inside the input argument. This makes it more useful for computing "

msgid ""
"The buffering operation is common in GIS workflows, and is also available in "
"PostGIS. :command:`ST_Buffer(geometry,distance)` takes in a buffer distance "
"and geometry type and outputs a polygon with a boundary the buffer distance "
"away from the input geometry."

"For example, if the US Park Service wanted to enforce a marine traffic zone "
"around Liberty Island, they might build a 500 meter buffer polygon around "
"the island. Liberty Island is a single census block in our "
"``nyc_census_blocks`` table, so we can easily extract and buffer it."

"The :command:`ST_Buffer` function also accepts negative distances and builds "

"Another classic GIS operation -- the \"overlay\" -- creates a new coverage "

"In the previous example we intersected geometries, creating a new geometry "

msgid ""
":command:`ST_Union(geometry, geometry)`: A two-argument version that takes "
"in two geometries and returns the merged union.  For example, our two-circle "
"example from the previous section looks like this when you replace the "
"intersection with a union."

msgid ""
":command:`ST_Union([geometry])`: An aggregate version that takes in a set of "
"geometries and returns the merged geometry for the entire group. The "
"aggregate ST_Union can be used with the ``GROUP BY`` SQL statement to create "
"carefully merged subsets of basic geometries. It is very powerful."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/geometry_returning.rst:116
msgid ""
"As an example of :command:`ST_Union` aggregation, consider our "
"``nyc_census_blocks`` table. Census geography is carefully constructed so "
"that larger geographies can be built up from smaller ones. So, we can create "
"a census tracts map by merging the blocks that form each tract (as we do "
"later in :ref:`creatingtractstable`). Or, we can create a county map by "
"merging blocks that fall within each county."

#: ../../en/geometry_returning.rst:118

"To carry out the merge, note that the unique key ``blkid`` actually embeds "
"information about the higher level geographies. Here are the parts of the "
"key for Liberty Island we used earlier:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/geometry_returning.rst:131
msgid ""
"So, we can create a county map by merging all geometries that share the same "
"first 5 digits of their ``blkid``. Be patient; this is computationally "
"expensive and can take a minute or two."

"An area test can confirm that our union operation did not lose any geometry. "
"First, we calculate the area of each individual census block, and sum those "
