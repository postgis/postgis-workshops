#: ../../en/introduction.rst:43
msgid ""
"An ordinary database has strings, numbers, and dates. A spatial database "
"adds additional (spatial) types for representing **geographic features**. "
"These spatial data types abstract and encapsulate spatial structures such as "
"boundary and dimension. In many respects, spatial data types can be "
"understood simply as shapes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:49
msgid ""

msgstr "空间索引与边界范围框"

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:55
msgid ""
"An ordinary database provides **indexes** to allow for fast and random "
"access to subsets of data.  Indexing for standard types (numbers, strings, "
"dates) is usually done with `B-tree <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree>`_ "
"indexes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:57
msgid ""
"A B-tree partitions the data using the natural sort order to put the data "
"into a hierarchical tree. The natural sort order of numbers, strings, and "
"dates is simple to determine -- every value is less than, greater than or "
"equal to every other value."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:59
msgid ""
"But because polygons can overlap, can be contained in one another, and are "
"arrayed in a two-dimensional (or more) space, a B-tree cannot be used to "
"efficiently index them. Real spatial databases provide a \"spatial index\" "
"that instead answers the question \"which objects are within this particular "
"bounding box?\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:61
msgid ""
"A **bounding box** is the smallest rectangle -- parallel to the coordinate "
"axes -- capable of containing a given feature."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:67
msgid ""
"Bounding boxes are used because answering the question \"is A inside B?\" is "
"very computationally intensive for polygons but very fast in the case of "
"rectangles.  Even the most complex polygons and linestrings can be "
"represented by a simple bounding box."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:69
msgid ""
"Indexes have to perform quickly in order to be useful. So instead of "
"providing exact results, as B-trees do, spatial indexes provide approximate "
"results. The question \"what lines are inside this polygon?\" will be "
"instead interpreted by a spatial index as \"what lines have bounding boxes "
"that are contained inside this polygon's bounding box?\""
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:71
msgid ""
"The actual spatial indexes implemented by various databases vary widely. The "
"most common implementations are the `R-Tree <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-"
"tree>`_ and `Quadtree <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree>`_ (used in "
"PostGIS), but there are also `grid-based indexes <http://en.wikipedia.org/"

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:76
msgid ""
"For manipulating data during a query, an ordinary database provides "
"**functions** such as concatenating strings, performing hash operations on "
"strings, doing mathematics on numbers, and extracting information from dates."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:78

"A spatial database provides a complete set of functions for analyzing "

"PostGIS turns the `PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org/>`_ Database "

"PostgreSQL is a powerful relational database management system (RDBMS). It "

"software. As with many other open source programs, PostgreSQL is not "
"controlled by any single company, but has a `global community of developers "
"<https://www.postgresql.org/community/contributors/>`_ and companies to "
"develop it."

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:100

"PostgreSQL was designed from the very start with type extension in mind -- "
"the ability to add new data types, functions and indexes at run-time. "

msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:119
msgid ""
"Because the development path for adding types to PostgreSQL was so "

msgid ""
"**Concurrent users can cause corruption and slowdowns.** While it's possible "
"to write extra code to ensure that multiple writes to the same file do not "

"a database system. Why not just use a standard database?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:130
msgid ""
"**Complicated questions require complicated software to answer.** "
"Complicated and interesting questions (spatial joins, aggregations, etc) "

"lines of specialized code to answer when programming against files."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:132
msgid ""
"Most users of PostGIS are setting up systems where multiple applications "
"will be expected to access the data, so having a standard SQL access method "

"As PostGIS data capacity grew, another issue surfaced: the representation "
"used to store geometry proved relatively inefficient. For small objects like "
"points and short lines, the metadata in the representation had as much as a "
"300% overhead. For performance reasons, it was necessary to put the "
