msgid ""
"PostGIS is a spatial database. Oracle Spatial and SQL Server (2008 and "
"later) are also spatial databases. But what does that mean; what is it that "
"makes an ordinary database a spatial database?"

"**Spatial databases store and manipulate spatial objects like any other "
"object in the database.**"

"The following briefly covers the evolution of spatial databases, and then "
"reviews three aspects that associate *spatial* data with a database -- data "
"types, indexes, and functions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:17

"**Spatial data types** refer to shapes such as point, line, and polygon;"

"Multi-dimensional **spatial indexing** is used for efficient processing of "
"spatial operations;"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:19
msgid ""
"**Spatial functions**, posed in :term:`SQL`, are for querying of spatial "
"properties and relationships."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:21

"Combined, spatial data types, indexes, and functions provide a flexible "
"structure for optimized performance and analysis."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:24
msgid "In the Beginning"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:26
msgid ""
"In legacy first-generation :term:`GIS` implementations, all spatial data is "
"stored in flat files and special :term:`GIS` software is required to "
"interpret and manipulate the data.  These first-generation management "
"systems are designed to meet the needs of users where all required data is "
"within the user's organizational domain.  They are proprietary, self-"
"contained systems specifically built for handling spatial data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:28
msgid ""
"Second-generation spatial systems store some data in relational databases "
"(usually the \"attribute\" or non-spatial parts) but still lack the "
"flexibility afforded with direct integration."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:30
msgid ""
"**True spatial databases were born when people started to treat spatial "
"features as first class database objects.**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:32
msgid ""
"Spatial databases fully integrate spatial data with a relational database.  "
"The system orientation changes from GIS-centric to database-centric."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:37
msgid ""
"A spatial database management system may be used in applications besides the "
"geographic world.  Spatial databases are used to manage data related to the "
"anatomy of the human body, large-scale integrated circuits, molecular "
"structures, and electro-magnetic fields, among others."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:41
msgid "Spatial Data Types"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:43
msgid ""
"An ordinary database has strings, numbers, and dates. A spatial database "
"adds additional (spatial) types for representing **geographic features**. "
"These spatial data types abstract and encapsulate spatial structures such as "
"boundary and dimension. In many respects, spatial data types can be "
"understood simply as shapes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:49
msgid ""
"Spatial data types are organized in a type hierarchy.  Each sub-type "
"inherits the structure (attributes) and the behavior (methods or functions) "
"of its super-type."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:53
msgid "Spatial Indexes and Bounding Boxes"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:55
msgid ""
"An ordinary database provides **indexes** to allow for fast and random "
"access to subsets of data.  Indexing for standard types (numbers, strings, "
"dates) is usually done with `B-tree <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree>`_ "
"indexes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:57
msgid ""
"A B-tree partitions the data using the natural sort order to put the data "
"into a hierarchical tree. The natural sort order of numbers, strings, and "
"dates is simple to determine -- every value is less than, greater than or "
"equal to every other value."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:59
msgid ""
"But because polygons can overlap, can be contained in one another, and are "
"arrayed in a two-dimensional (or more) space, a B-tree cannot be used to "
"efficiently index them. Real spatial databases provide a \"spatial index\" "
"that instead answers the question \"which objects are within this particular "
"bounding box?\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:61
msgid ""
"A **bounding box** is the smallest rectangle -- parallel to the coordinate "
"axes -- capable of containing a given feature."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:67
msgid ""
"Bounding boxes are used because answering the question \"is A inside B?\" is "
"very computationally intensive for polygons but very fast in the case of "
"rectangles.  Even the most complex polygons and linestrings can be "
"represented by a simple bounding box."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:69
msgid ""
"Indexes have to perform quickly in order to be useful. So instead of "
"providing exact results, as B-trees do, spatial indexes provide approximate "
"results. The question \"what lines are inside this polygon?\" will be "
"instead interpreted by a spatial index as \"what lines have bounding boxes "
"that are contained inside this polygon's bounding box?\""
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:71
msgid ""
"The actual spatial indexes implemented by various databases vary widely. The "
"most common implementations are the `R-Tree <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-"
"tree>`_ and `Quadtree <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree>`_ (used in "
"PostGIS), but there are also `grid-based indexes <http://en.wikipedia.org/"
"wiki/Grid_(spatial_index)>`_ and `GeoHash indexes <https://en.wikipedia.org/"
"wiki/Geohash>`_ implemented in other spatial databases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:74
msgid "Spatial Functions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:76
msgid ""
"For manipulating data during a query, an ordinary database provides "
"**functions** such as concatenating strings, performing hash operations on "
"strings, doing mathematics on numbers, and extracting information from dates."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:78
msgid ""
"A spatial database provides a complete set of functions for analyzing "
"geometric components, determining spatial relationships, and manipulating "
"geometries.  These spatial functions serve as the building block for any "
"spatial project."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:80
msgid ""
"The majority of all spatial functions can be grouped into one of the "
"following five categories:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:82
msgid ""
"**Conversion**: Functions that *convert* between geometries and external "
"data formats."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:83
msgid ""
"**Management**: Functions that *manage* information about spatial tables and "
"PostGIS administration."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:84
msgid ""
"**Retrieval**: Functions that *retrieve* properties and measurements of a "
"Geometry."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:85
msgid ""
"**Comparison**: Functions that *compare* two geometries with respect to "
"their spatial relation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:86
msgid "**Generation**: Functions that *generate* new geometries from others."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:88
msgid ""
"The list of possible functions is very large, but a common set of functions "
"is defined by the :term:`OGC` :term:`SFSQL` and implemented (along with "
"additional useful functions) by PostGIS."
msgstr ""

msgid "What is PostGIS?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:93
msgid ""
"PostGIS turns the `PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org/>`_ Database "
"Management System into a spatial database by adding support for the three "
"features: spatial types, spatial indexes, and spatial functions.  Because it "
"is built on PostgreSQL, PostGIS automatically inherits important \"enterprise"
"\" features as well as open standards for implementation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:96
msgid "But what is PostgreSQL?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:98
msgid ""
"PostgreSQL is a powerful relational database management system (RDBMS). It "
"is released under a BSD-style license and is thus free and open source "
"software. As with many other open source programs, PostgreSQL is not "
"controlled by any single company, but has a `global community of developers "
"<https://www.postgresql.org/community/contributors/>`_ and companies to "
"develop it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:100
msgid ""
"PostgreSQL was designed from the very start with type extension in mind -- "
"the ability to add new data types, functions and indexes at run-time. "
"Because of this, the PostGIS extension can be developed by a separate "
"development team, yet still integrate very tightly into the core PostgreSQL "
"database."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:103
msgid "Why choose PostgreSQL?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:105
msgid ""
"A common question from people familiar with open source databases is, \"Why "
"wasn't PostGIS built on MySQL?\"."

"Combined, PostgreSQL provides a very easy development path to add new "
"spatial types. In the proprietary world, only `Illustra <https://en."
"wikipedia.org/wiki/Illustra>`_ (now Informix Universal Server) allowed such "
"easy extension. This is no coincidence; Illustra is a proprietary re-working "
"of the original PostgreSQL code base from the 1980's."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:119
msgid ""
"Because the development path for adding types to PostgreSQL was so "
"straightforward, it made sense to start there. When MySQL released basic "
"spatial types in version 4.1, the PostGIS team took a look at their code, "
"and the exercise reinforced the original decision to use PostgreSQL."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:121
msgid ""
"Because MySQL spatial objects had to be hacked on top of the string type as "
"a special case, the MySQL code was spread over the entire code base. "
"Development of PostGIS 0.1 took under a month. Doing a \"MyGIS\" 0.1 would "
"have taken a lot longer, and as such, might never have seen the light of day."

"The `Shapefile <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile>`_ (and other formats "
"like the Esri File Geodatabase and the `GeoPackage <https://www.geopackage."
"org/>`_) have been a standard way of storing and interacting with spatial "
"data since GIS software was first written. However, these \"flat\" files "
"have the following disadvantages:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:128
msgid ""
"**Files require special software to read and write.**  SQL is an abstraction "
"for random data access and analysis. Without that abstraction, you will need "
"to write all the access and analysis code yourself."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:129
msgid ""
"**Concurrent users can cause corruption and slowdowns.** While it's possible "
"to write extra code to ensure that multiple writes to the same file do not "
"corrupt the data, by the time you have solved the problem and also solved "
"the associated performance problem, you will have written the better part of "
"a database system. Why not just use a standard database?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:130
msgid ""
"**Complicated questions require complicated software to answer.** "
"Complicated and interesting questions (spatial joins, aggregations, etc) "
"that are expressible in one line of SQL in the database take hundreds of "
"lines of specialized code to answer when programming against files."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:132
msgid ""
"Most users of PostGIS are setting up systems where multiple applications "
"will be expected to access the data, so having a standard SQL access method "
"simplifies deployment and development. Some users are working with large "
"data sets; with files, they might be segmented into multiple files, but in a "
"database they can be stored as a single large table."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:134
msgid ""
"In summation, the combination of support for multiple users, complex ad hoc "
"queries, and performance on large data sets are what sets spatial databases "
"apart from file-based systems."

"In the May of 2001, `Refractions Research <http://www.refractions.net/>`_  "
"released the first version of PostGIS. PostGIS 0.1 had objects, indexes and "
"a handful of functions. The result was a database suitable for storage and "
"retrieval, but not analysis."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:141
msgid ""
"As the number of functions increased, the need for an organizing principle "
"became clear.  The \"Simple Features for SQL\" (:term:`SFSQL`) specification "
"from the Open Geospatial Consortium provided such structure with guidelines "
"for function naming and requirements."
msgstr ""

"With PostGIS support for simple analysis and spatial joins, `Mapserver "
"<http://mapserver.org/>`_ became the first external application to provide "
"visualization of data in the database."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:145
msgid ""
"Over the next several years the number of PostGIS functions grew, but its "
"power remained limited. Many of the most interesting functions (e.g., "
"ST_Intersects(), ST_Buffer(), ST_Union()) were very difficult to code.  "
"Writing them from scratch promised years of work."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:147
msgid ""
"Fortunately a second project, the \"Geometry Engine, Open Source\" or `GEOS "
"<http://trac.osgeo.org/geos>`_, came along. The GEOS library provides the "
"necessary algorithms for implementing the :term:`SFSQL` specification. By "
"linking in GEOS, PostGIS provided complete support for :term:`SFSQL` by "
"version 0.8."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/introduction.rst:149
msgid ""
"As PostGIS data capacity grew, another issue surfaced: the representation "
"used to store geometry proved relatively inefficient. For small objects like "
"points and short lines, the metadata in the representation had as much as a "
"300% overhead. For performance reasons, it was necessary to put the "
"representation on a diet.  By shrinking the metadata header and required "
"dimensions, overhead greatly reduced. In PostGIS 1.0, this new, faster, "
"lightweight representation became the default."
