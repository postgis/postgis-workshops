msgid "Linear referencing (sometimes called \"dynamic segmentation\") is a means of representing features that can be described by referencing a base set of linear features. Common examples of features that are modelled using linear referencing are:"

#: ../../en/linear_referencing.rst:13
msgid "The benefit of linear referencing models is that the dependent spatial observations do not need to be separately recorded from the base observations, and updates to the base observation layer can be carried out knowing that the dependent observations will automatically track the new geometry."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/linear_referencing.rst:17
msgid "The Esri terminological convention for linear referencing is to have a base table of linear spatial features, and a non-spatial table of \"events\" which includes a foreign key reference to the spatial feature and a measure along the referenced feature. We will use the term \"event table\" to refer to the non-spatial tables we build."

msgid "If you have an existing point table that you want to reference to a linear network, use the :command:`ST_LineLocatePoint` function, which takes a line and point, and returns the proportion along the line that the point can be found."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/linear_referencing.rst:35
msgid "We can convert the **nyc_subway_stations** into an \"event table\" relative to the streets by using :command:`ST_LineLocatePoint`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/linear_referencing.rst:70
msgid "Once we have an event table, it's fun to turn it back into a spatial view, so we can visualize the events relative to the original points they were derived from."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/linear_referencing.rst:72
msgid "To go from a measure to a point, we use the :command:`ST_LineInterpolatePoint` function. Here's our previous simple examples reversed:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/linear_referencing.rst:81
msgid "And we can join the **nyc_subway_station_events** tables back to the **nyc_streets** table and use the **measure** attribute to generate the spatial event points, without referencing the original **nyc_subway_stations** table."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/linear_referencing.rst:95
msgid "Viewing the original (red star) and event (blue circle) points with the streets, you can see how the events are snapped directly to the closest street lines."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/linear_referencing.rst:102
msgid "One surprising use of the linear referencing functions has nothing to do with linear referencing models. As shown above, it's possible to use the functions to snap points to linear features. For use cases like GPS tracks or other inputs that are expected to reference a linear network, snapping is a handy feature to have available."
