Translation files for the postgis-intro workshop

Compilation of the files require the ``pip install sphinx-intl`` python3.

To build localized refer to the README.md in root.

Using Weblate
---------------

Weblate web-ui for translation is at:
https://weblate.osgeo.org/projects/postgis-workshop/

There is a web-hook `https://weblate.osgeo.org/hooks/github/` defined in https://github.com/postgis/postgis-workshops/settings/hooks that pushes changes to weblate.

Weblate does require that the pot files be kept up to date.
To do so:

```
#if using python virtual env
python3 -m venv ~/pw-env

cd postgis-intro/sources/en
make pot
#test the translations
LANG=ja make html-translation
LANG=sv make html-translation
LANG=de make html-translation
LANG=es make html-translation
LANG=it make html-translation
git add .
git commit -m "Update pots"
git push
```

The github account osgeoweblate has commit rights to this repo.
Any translations that pass approval in the weblate https://weblate.osgeo.org/projects/postgis-workshop/ get pushed and automatically committed.

The postgis.net, has a cronjob that runs every 5 minutes or so checking for updates and runs this script `/var/www/postgis_workshop_update.sh` if any changes.  This builds the main english and all the translations. If new translations are added, then this script needs to be updated to build them.
