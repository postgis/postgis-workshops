"Unlike a distance search, the \"nearest neighbour\" search doesn't include "
"any measurement restricting how far away candidate geometries might be, "
"features of any distance away will be accepted, as long as they are the "

"PostgreSQL solves the nearest neighbor problem by introducing an \"order by "
"distance\" (``<->``) operator that induces the database to use an index to "
"speed up a sorted return set. With an \"order by distance\" operator in "
"place, a nearest neighbor query can return the \"N nearest features\" just "
"by adding an ordering and limiting the result set to N entries."

"演算子の導入によって最近傍問題を解決しました。あるべき \"order by distance\" "
"演算子との併用で、順序の設定と、N "

"番目の最も近い地物」を返すことができます。"

"The \"order by distance\" operator works for both geometry and geography "
"types.  The only difference between how they work between the two types is "
"the distance value returned.  For geometry ``<->`` returns the same answer "
"as `ST_Distance` which is dependent on the units of the spatial reference "
"system in use. For geography the distance value returned is the sphere "
"distance, instead of the more accurate spheroidal distance that "
"``ST_Distance(geography,geography)`` returns."

"How can we be sure we are getting an index-assisted query? It's a good idea "
"to check the ``EXPLAIN`` output for a nearest-neighbor query, because it's "
"possible to get correct answers from non-indexed SQL and the lack of an "
"index might not be obvious until the size of the tables scales up."

"The index assisted order by operator has one major draw back: it only works "
"with a **single geometry literal** on one side of the operator. This is fine "
"for finding the objects nearest to one query object, but does not help for a "
"spatial join, where the goal is to find the nearest neighbor for each of a "
"full set of candidates."

"Note the way the ``CROSS JOIN LATERAL`` acts as the inner part of a loop "
