"PostgreSQL is a very versatile database system, capable of running "
"efficiently in very low-resource environments and environments shared "
"with a variety of other applications.  In order to ensure it will run "
"properly for many different environments, the default configuration is "
"very conservative and not terribly appropriate for a high-performance "
"production database.  Add the fact that geospatial databases have "
"different usage patterns, and the data tend to consist of fewer, much "
"larger records than non-geospatial databases, and you can see that the "
"default configuration will not be totally appropriate for our purposes."

"All of these configuration parameters can edited in the `postgresql.conf`"

"Sets the amount of memory the database server uses for shared memory "

msgid "effective_cache_size"
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/tuning.rst:28
msgid ""
"In addition to the memory PostgreSQL sets aside for ``shared_buffers`` "
"the query planner also takes into account how many disk blocks the "
"operating system may have cached as part of its virtual file system. For "
"systems with large amount of memory, this can be quite large. The "
"``effective_cache_size`` is approximately the amount of memory on the "
"machine, less the ``shared_buffers``, less the ``work_mem`` times the "
"expected number of connections, less any memory required for any other "
"processes running on the machine, less about 1GB for other random "
"operating system needs. The database will not **use** the extra cache "
"directly, but it will compute plans expecting that the operating system "
"has cached filesystem data in about that much memory."

msgid ""
"Defines the amount of memory that internal sorting operations, indexing "
"operations and hash tables can consume before the database switches to "
"on-disk files.  This value defines the available memory for each "
"operation; complex queries may have several sort or hash operations "
"running in parallel, and each connected session may be executing a query."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/tuning.rst:40
msgid ""
"As such you must consider how many connections and the complexity of "
"expected queries before increasing this value.  The **benefit** to "
"increasing is that the processing of more of these operations, including "
"ORDER BY, and DISTINCT clauses, merge and hash joins, hash-based "
"aggregation and hash-based processing of subqueries, can be accomplished "
"without incurring disk writes. The **cost** of increasing is memory that "
"will be used **per connection**, which can be quite high with production "
"levels of connections."

"Defines the amount of memory used for maintenance operations, including "

"terribly common, a higher value will only exact an occasional cost, and "

"Sets the amount of memory used for write-ahead log (WAL) data.  Write-"
"ahead logs provide a high-performance mechanism for insuring data-"
"integrity.  During each change command, the effects of the changes are "
"written first to the WAL files and flushed to disk.  Only once the WAL "
"files have been flushed will the changes be written to the data files "
"themselves.  This allows the data files to be written to disk in an "
"optimal and asynchronous manner while ensuring that, in the event of a "
"crash, all data changes can be recovered from the WAL."

"The size of this buffer only needs to be large enough to hold WAL data "

"This value sets the maximum number of log file segments (typically 16MB) "
"that can be filled between automatic WAL checkpoints.  A WAL checkpoint "
"is a point in the sequence of WAL transactions at which it is guaranteed "
"that the data files have been updated with all information before the "
"checkpoint.  At this time all dirty data pages are flushed to disk and a "
"checkpoint record is written to the log file.  This allows the crash "
"recovery process to find the latest checkpoint record and apply all "
"following log segments to complete the data recovery."
msgstr ""

#: ../../en/tuning.rst:80
msgid ""
"Because the checkpoint process requires the flushing of all dirty data "
"pages to disk, it creates a significant I/O load.  The same argument from"
" above applies; geospatial data is large enough to unbalance non-"
